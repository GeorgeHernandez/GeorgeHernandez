# Google Wish List

summary:: Just a few personal requests for Google.

## Android

- Better capabilities for open & editing text (`*.txt`) files in Google Drive.
- See more notes in Google Drive section.
- Enter line breaks within a cell in Google Sheets:
  - Workarounds:
    - Do it in another app (e.g. Google Keep), then copy paste into the cell.
    - Enter it as a Comment or Note within the cell, then copy paste into the cell.

## Gmail

- 2023-08-17 When composing a message the "Check spelling" option should take 1 click instead of 2. I use it more frequently than some of the other functions on the bottom of the desktop interface -- even though squiggly underscores appear on common tyos.

## Google Calendar

- The "Today" button should be grayed out if today is visible.
- 2023-03-04 The option to hide the calendars for Reminders and Tasks.

## Google Chrome

- Vertical bookmarks like Microsoft Edge
  - 2022-08-20 At some point Google Chrome added a Sidebar with 2 nice items: A Reading List and Bookmarks in a vertical tree format.

## Google Contacts

- 2023-05-18 The option to display contact's nickname too. E.g. Elvis "The King" Presley.

## Google Documents

- [Different headers for 1st page](https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/docs/RAlw_h8pYMU/NueqC1Dm8x0J)
  - 2015-02-25 Glory! After 26 pages of forum discussions since 2011-09-28, Google Documents now allows you to have a first page with a different header/footer from the other page. 0-index!
- Ability to export as HTML that is simpler, cleaner, or minimalist.
- [Text folding / Code folding](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/docs/tVIgbwtAYtI])
- 2020-02-18 Just as there is a keyboard shortcut to apply italic styling (ctrl+i) or heading 1 (ctrl+alt+1), I would like a shortcut for PRE styling or a way to do it in a Markdown fashion.
- 2022-09-07 A way to insert a Document Summary in the Document that stays in sync with the Document Summary on the left.

## Google Keep

- Enable sorting for lists: Ascending, Descending. To keep it simple: Ignore sorting nested or checked items.
- 2023-05-18 For a checklist, the option to select all options.

## Google Drawings

- I would like more shapes.

## Google Drive

- [Ability to sync only selected sub folders](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/drive/Gs2w1BL-B9U)
  - 2012-08-27 The request was first made.
  - 2015-05-26 The current work around is to carefully use "Add To" (shift+z). https://support.google.com/a/answer/2789107?hl=en. Undo the "Add To" by using "Move To..." to move it to its original location.
  - 2016-04-13 This capability has been enabled for the latest version.
- Ability to upload photos as "Original" or "High Quality" instead of just "Original".
- Ability to change photos from "Original" to "High Quality".
- Ability to move items from Google Drive to Google Photos and vice versa. Without duplicating.
- 2016-03-04 Removing (deleting) an item that is in multiple locations should NOT remove it from all locations, just the current location. This is the way Google Photos works.
- 2017-03-08 If a folder has no sub-folders, then it should have no little arrow next to it.
- 2017-04-04 The ability to search from a particular directory.
  - At some point this was done.
- 2017-05-12 Google Drive arranges Google Photos by year and month for some accounts but not others. https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/drive/zjcT66sK43k/8d3uVPgRDQAJ.
  - 2015-06-17 The request was first made.
- The ability to edit \*.txt files on Android.
  - 2017-05-25 Currently you can open it with Google Docs, but what it does is make a copy of the content and saves it in My Drive as a Google Docs document and leaves the original untouched.
  - 2017-05-25 Install QuickEdit on Android. From Google Drive, select your text file and open with QuickEdit. Works on many extensions, but some (e.g. \*.yaml) will need to have the extension changed to \*.txt temporarily.
- 2022-04-08 Better file summary descriptions. Right now they show in 2 places: Google Drive and in document outlines. There should be an option to have it show within Documents, Sheets, etc.

## Google Photos

- 2016-02-02 When you add a photo to an album, the albums should be listed alphabetically, most photos, etc. Also search.
- 2016-06-02 The way Google Keep does Labels is perfect: 1 interface: Lists Labels alphabetically; Allows check/uncheck; Allows Insert. Separate interface for Updates and Deletes of Labels.
- 2016-03-02 The ability to add a photo to multiple albums at a time instead of 1 album at a time.
- 2016-03-02 The ability to adjust the "zoom" of viewing multiple photos. This capability is available on Android, but not via the app on Windows. However you can fake it by modifying the zoom in the browser.
- 2016-04-28 Keyboard shortcuts for adding to an album and choosing which albums to add to.
- 2017-05-07 For mobile the options for Backup and Sync should be split.
- 2019-05-30 "Transparency on PNG files is displayed as black on mobile, making black text unreadable." (https://support.google.com/photos/thread/2046456?hl=en).
- 2021-12-92 For mobile, when you get the info in an item it should tell you what albums the item is in.

## Google Sheets

- [Page breaks](https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/docs/ZSRZYzxPsUQ/fQRAp4cgApEJ)
  - 2018-04-11 Google finally enabled this and a bunch of other things like macros, custom paper sizes, row or column grouping (folding), adding checkboxes, etc. See https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/04/think-macro-google-sheets.html.
- [Grouping](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/docs/pm4Gd4O_Bm0)
  - 2018-04-11 Google enabled.
- [Set default font for new sheets](https://support.google.com/docs/forum/AAAABuH1jm097HlWPMZkiE?hl=en). Templates are insufficient.
- Move tabs from bottom to the top
  - 2018-10-10 Approximating it with the "Spreadsheet Tabs On Top" extension for Chrome.
  - 2018-10-15 I like tabs on top, but this extension mucks with the scroll bars and handles vertical space oddly.
- Keyboard shortcut to change font.
- 2022-05-01 Just as you filtering is on the toolbar and you can save & name your custom filters, then sorting should be on the toolbar and you should be able to save & name your custom sorting.`

## Google Tasks

- 2023-03-23 While there is a dedicated mobile app for Tasks, there is no dedicated URL for Tasks on the browser. https://tasks.google.com/ doesn't work, but this lame hack does: https://tasks.google.com/embed/list/~default?origin=https://mail.google.com&fullWidth=1&lfhs=2. Tasks is only manifested as a sidebar for Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, and Chat. Perhaps Tasks was meant to be so light that it doesn't need a dedicated URL? In any case the user should have the choice between a sidebar or a dedicated URL.
- 2023-03-23 It would be nice to have Tasks as a sidebar for Keep on its dedicated URL https://keep.google.com/.

## Google Workspace (Office)

- Keyboard shortcuts to open & navigate side panels.
- Keep in the side panel: The ability to rearrange notes.
- Add Google Drive to the side panel
- More fonts & consistent in the suite. E.g. Why is Lucida Console available for Google Sheets but not Google Documents?

## YouTube

- 2015-11-20 Enable moving videos between lists.
