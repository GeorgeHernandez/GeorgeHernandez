# Markdown Notes

summary:: Notes on Markdown, a lightweight markup language that converts into HTML.

**N.B. DO NOT edit this files in an autoformatting setting because it has many purposeful "exceptions".**

## Block HTML

### Headers (h*n*)

Prefix with `1..6` pound signs (`#`). E.g.

```markdown
# h1

## h2

### h3

#### h4

##### h5

###### h6
```

becomes:

# h1

## h2

### h3

#### h4

##### h5

###### h6

For h1 and h2, you can also use a syntax of underlining with `=` or `-` respectively. E.g.

```markdown
# h1

## h2
```

becomes:

# h1

## h2

### Horizontal rules (hr)

Put several `*`, `-`, or `_` on their own line, i.e. prefixed and suffixed by `\r`. E.g.

```markdown
foo

---

bar
```

becomes:

foo

---

bar

### Paragraphs (p)

Paragraphs are followed by 2 newlines. E.g.

```markdown
Sentence 1a of Paragraph 1 is followed by 2 newlines.

Sentence 2a of Paragraph 2.
Sentence 2b of Paragraph 2.
```

becomes:

Sentence 1a of Paragraph #1 is followed by 2 newlines.

Sentence 2a of Paragraph 2.
Sentence 2b of Paragraph 2.

### Breaks (br)

A break within a paragraph is done several ways:

- 1 backslash (`\`) at the end of the line.
- 1 literal `<br>` at the end of the line. **Avoid since some systems abhor inline HTML.**
- 2 spaces (`  `) at the end of the line. **Avoid since some systems auto-delete trailing whitespace.**
- 1 newline (instead of 2) at the end of the line. **Avoid since this doesn't work in some systems.**

E.g.

```markdown
This line ends in 1 backslash (`\`)\
The next line

This line ends in 1 literal `<br>`<br>
The next line

This line ends in 2 spaces (`  `)
The next line

This line ends in 1 newline
The next line
```

becomes:

This line ends in 1 backslash (`\`)\
The next line

This line ends in 1 literal `<br>`<br>
The next line

This line ends in 2 spaces (`  `)
The next line

This line ends in 1 newline
The next line

### Block quotes (blockquote)

Block quotes are prefixed with a `>`. E.g.

```markdown
A blockquote followed by 2 returns makes 2 blockquotes.

> Blockquote 1.

> Blockquote 2.

Usually you want regular text between blockquotes to make it explicit.

> Blockquote 3.

If 2 sequential blockquotes are separated by 1 return, then they are **automatically joined** into 1 blockquote.

> Blockquote 4.
> This is still part of Blockquote 4.
> This very long line is also part of Blockquote #4. Yes, it is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long line.

If you want a visual blank line within a blockquote, then the prefix the blank line with a `>`.

> Blockquote 5.
>
> This is still part of Blockquote 5

A blockquote can have a nested quote.

> Blockquote 6.
>
> > Blockquote 6a is nexted within Blockquote 6.
> > Will line A belong to Blockquote 6 or 6a?
> > Will line B belong to Blockquote 6 or 6a?
>
> Will line C belong to Blockquote 6 or 6a?
```

becomes:

A blockquote followed by 2 returns makes 2 blockquotes.

> Blockquote 1.

> Blockquote 2.

Usually you want regular text between blockquotes to make it explicit.

> Blockquote 3.

If 2 sequential blockquotes are separated by 1 return, then they are **automatically joined** into 1 blockquote.

> Blockquote 4.
> This is still part of Blockquote 4.
> This very long line is also part of Blockquote #4. Yes, it is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long line.

If you want a visual blank line within a blockquote, then the prefix the blank line with a `>`.

> Blockquote 5.
>
> This is still part of Blockquote 5

A blockquote can have a nested quote.

> Blockquote 6.
>
> > Blockquote 6a is nexted within Blockquote 6.
> > Will line A belong to Blockquote 6 or 6a?
> > Will line B belong to Blockquote 6 or 6a?
>
> Will line C belong to Blockquote 6 or 6a?

### Preformatted Code (pre)

Preformatted code is prefixed with 4 spaces (`    `). E.g.

```markdown
    `pre` via 4 spaces.
```

becomes:

    `pre` via 4 spaces

Alternatively "fencing" tags the block with 3 back ticks (` ``` `). E.g.

    ```
    `pre` via tagging with 3 back ticks (aka fencing)
    ```

becomes:

```
`pre` via tagging with 3 back ticks (aka fencing)
```

With fencing, you can suffix the opening backticks with the language used. E.g.

````markdown
```javascript
let s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
````

becomes:

```javascript
let s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

### Lists (ul, ol, li)

Unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items with a simple syntax. E.g.

````markdown
- Nest lists with indentation.

  - Use a Dash, but supposedly `*` and `+` work too.
  - This list item
    breaks via `\r` (and may not work)
  - This list item\
    break via `\r\`
  - This list item

    breaks via `\r\r`

  - List item
    > with a blockquote
  - List item

    ```html
    with PRE
    ```

1. Make numbered lists
1. via any integer and a period.
   1. Short items don't need a list
   1. as much as long items do.
      1971\. The backslash escapes and avoids a list item.
````

becomes:

- Nest lists with indentation.

  - Use a Dash, but supposedly `*` and `+` work too.
  - This list item
    breaks via `\r`
  - This list item\
    break via `\r\`
  - This list item

    breaks via `\r\r`

  - List item
    > with a blockquote
  - List item

    ```html
    with PRE
    ```

1. Make numbered lists
1. via any integer and a period.
   1. Short items don't need a list
   1. as much as long items do.
      1971\. The backslash escapes and avoids a list item.

Github's Markdown allows TODO lists. E.g.

```markdown
- [ ] TODO
- [/] Doing (not implemented)
- [\] Doing (not implemented)
- [x] Done
```

becomes:

- [ ] TODO
- [/] Doing (not implemented)
- [\] Doing (not implemented)
- [x] Done

## Span HTML

### Basic spans (em, strong, code, s)

The `em` tag is made with single asterisks (preferred because underscores are more often parts of words) or single underscores, and is usually rendered as italics. E.g. `*foo*` becomes _foo_ and `_foo_` becomes _foo_.

The `strong` tag is made with double asterisks (preferred because underscores are more often parts of words) or double underscores. E.g. `**foo**` becomes **foo** and `__foo__` becomes **foo**.

To use both `em` and `strong` tripple asterisks (preferred because underscores are more often parts of words) or triple underscores, and is usually rendered as bold. E.g. `***foo***` becomes **_foo_** and `___foo___` becomes **_foo_**.

The `code` tag is made with single backticks, and is usually rendered as monospace. E.g. `` `foo` `` becomes `foo`. To display multiple backticks, then enclose with even more backticks! E.g. ` ````enclose code with 3 backticks (```) with 4 backticks```` ` becomes ` enclose code with 3 backticks (```) with 4 backticks `.

The `strike` tag is HTML 5 obsolete in favor of the `s` tag or the `ins` and `del` tag pair. In Markdowns the `s` tag is made with double tildes, and is usually rendered as a strikethrough. E.g `~~foo~~` become ~~foo~~.

### Links (a)

- URL #1. E.g. `http://example.com` & `foo@example.com` become http://example.com & foo@example.com.
- URL #2. E.g. `<http://example.com>` & `<foo@example.com>` become <http://example.com> & <foo@example.com>.
- Alt, URL. E.g. `[example](https://example.com)` becomes [example](http://example.com).
- Alt, URL, title. E.g. `[example](https://example.com "tooltip")` becomes [example](http://example.com "tooltip").
- Local relative link. E.g. `[About](CSE.md)` becomes [CSE](CSE.md).
- Format links. E.g.
  - `**[example](https://example.com)**` becomes **[example](https://example.com)**
  - `_[example](https://example.com)_` becomes _[example](https://example.com)_
  - `` [`example`](https://example.com) `` becomes [`example`](https://example.com)
- Encoding. It safer to URL encode some characters in URLs. E.g.
  - `[foo](https://example/my%20foo)` becomes [foo](https://example/my%20foo)
  - `[bar](https://example/identity_%28id%29)` becomes [bar](https://example/identity_%28id%29)
  - `<a href="https://example/identity_(id)">bar</a>` becomes <a href="https://example/identity_(id)">bar</a>

A reference-style link has 2 parts:

- The URL is refrenced by an ID that is specified anywhere on the page but often at the end of the document. E.g.
  - `[1]:  https://example.com/1`
  - `[2]: <https://example.com/2>`
  - `[3]:  https://example.com/3 "tooltip"`
  - `[4]: <https://example.com/4> "tooltip"`
- The ID can be used 1..N times on the page. E.g.
  - `[One][1] and [Two] [2] are good but [Two][2] is better`

### Images (img)

Alt, URL. E.g.

`![Google](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)`

becomes

![Google](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)

Alt, URL, title. E.g.

`![Google](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png "rocks")`

becomes

![Google](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png "rocks")

Alt, URL, title, href. E.g.

`[![Google](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png "rocks")](https://google.com)`

becomes

[![Google](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png "rocks")](https://google.com)

## Inline HTML

The characters `&`, `<`, and `>` are usually automatically escaped. E.g.

`AT&T` becomes `AT&amp;T`

`7 < 8` becomes `7 &lt; 8`

`8 > 7` becomes `8 &gt; 7`

Certain characters can be escaped with a preceding backslash (`\`) to preserve the literal display of a character instead of its special Markdown meaning. This applies to the following characters:

```text
\  backslash
`  backtick
*  asterisk
_  underscore
{} curly braces
[] square brackets
() parentheses
#  hash mark
>  greater than
+  plus sign
-  minus sign (hyphen)
.  dot
!  exclamation mark
```

## Tables (table, tr, th, td)

Markdown has syntax for implementing simpler tables. E.g.

```markdown
| TH cells      |         are          | bold & centered by default |
| ------------- | :------------------: | -------------------------: |
| col 1 is      |     left-aligned     |                  some text |
| col 2 is      |       centered       |                        $69 |
| col 3 is      |    right-aligned     |                     $69420 |
| col 4 is      |    right-aligned     |                       $420 |
| zebra stripes |         are          |                  automated |
| _em_          |      **strong**      |                     `code` |
|               | alas no joined cells |
```

becomes:

| TH cells      |         are          | bold & centered by default |
| ------------- | :------------------: | -------------------------: |
| col 1 is      |     left-aligned     |                  some text |
| col 2 is      |       centered       |                        $69 |
| col 3 is      |    right-aligned     |                     $69420 |
| col 4 is      |    right-aligned     |                       $420 |
| zebra stripes |         are          |                  automated |
| _em_          |      **strong**      |                     `code` |
|               | alas no joined cells |                            |

Alternatively you can try raw HTML. E.g.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>My header</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Table HTML MAY work in Markdown</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

MAY become:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>My header</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Table HTML MAY work in Markdown</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Etc

Markdown does not cover all HTML.

- To do subscripts, use raw HTML. E.g. `H<sub>2</sub>O is water` becomes H<sub>2</sub>O is water. Alternatively you could use naturally superscripted characters. E.g. `H₂O is water` becomes H₂O is water.
- To do superscripts, use raw HTML. E.g. `3<sup>2</sup> = 9` becomes 3<sup>2</sup> = 9. Alternatively you could use naturally superscripted characters. E.g. `3² = 9` becomes 3² = 9.

### Glossaries

Raw HTML may be used for glossaries. E.g.

```html
<dl>
  <dt>term</dt>
  <dd>definition</dd>
  <dt>term 2</dt>
  <dd>definition 2</dd>
</dl>
```

MAY become:

<dl>
  <dt>term</dt>
  <dd>definition</dd>
  <dt>term 2</dt>
  <dd>definition 2</dd>
</dl>
