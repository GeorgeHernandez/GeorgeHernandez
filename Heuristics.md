    - [Epistemology](#epistemology)
    - [Perspective](#perspective)

## Epistemology

- How do you know?
- "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." ~ Richard Feynman
- Common sense, experimentation, scientific method.

## Perspective

- If you don't have perspective, then you may just be reacting.
- Effectiveness != Efficacy
- Effectiveness > Efficiency.
    - Safety > Efficiency.
    - Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
- Prioritize
    - Sequence matters. E.g. Recipes follow a sequence.
    - The urgent & important
    - Pareto principle: The vital few with the most ROI
- The Greek language denotes two distinct principles, [Chronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronos) and [Kairos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos). The former refers to numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally "the right or opportune moment", relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.
- "There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat; And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures." ~ William Shakespeare, "Julius Caesar" (1599), Brutus in scene iii of Act IV.
- "Vita brevis, ars longa, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile." (Latin), "Life is short, the craft long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult." -Hippocrates. First line of "Aphorisms" from the "Hippocratic Corpus".
- Creating > Curating > Collecting > Consuming
- [All the world's a stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world%27s_a_stage). Aka the seven ages of man.
    - Infant
    - Schoolboy
    - Lover
    - Soldier
    - Justice
    - Pantaloon
    - Oblivion
- [Five Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws). Who, What, Why When, Where + How
- Essential > Incidental
    - Essential > Accidental
- Impossible to Possible to Probable to Functional to Perfect

## Manage your suffering

- Stoicism. What you can affect.
- Namaste > Living in a world of poison
- Reduce: confusion, drama, discouragement, pracrastination
- Wabi-Sabi: [Imperfect, Incomplete, Impermanent]
- Serenity Prayer

    ```text
    God, grant me
    The serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
    The courage to change the things I can,
    And the wisdom to know the difference.
    ```

- The essence of Zen is non-fixation.
    - Do you have X? Or does X have you?
    - Mindful > Mindless
    - Be present
- Manage your cortisol

## Manage complexity

- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- üå±‚è≥üå≥.
- As simple as possible, but no simpler
- Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- You ain't gonna need it (YAGNI). Counter balances too much DRY.
- Don't reinvent the wheel.
- "A journey of a thousand miles begines with a single step.
- Modularity: Large complex wholes can only be actualized, managed, summed, and synergized with small simple parts.
- 1.01^365 = 37.8, i.e. Daily 1% growth results in huge annual growth.
- Analysis & Syntheis
    - E.g. Many mindlessly consider health as binary (healthy or sick), but is actually large & complex, and thus should be broken into smaller and simpler components for analysis. Howwever some focus so much on the analyis that the holistic synthesis is lost.

## Better actions

- Form follows function
    - Function is WHAT is to be done or made. Form is HOW it is done or made.
    - "Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, form ever follows function, and this is the law. Where function does not change, form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling. It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. This is the law." ~ Louis Sullivan. "The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered" (1896)
    - It is possible to focus on the form regardless of the function (e.g. tea ceremony), but if you can derive more significance from the function, then its signal increases.
    - It is possible to focus on the form so much that it loses connection to its function. E.g. A martial art that becomes a dance; This may be acceptable when done as art for art's sake
- Quality. E.g. ISO 9000
- Growth = Stress + Rest. E.g. PDCA, Kaizen, Virtuous Circle
- (story, struggle) > (excellence, experience)
- Problem Solving:
    - Understand.
    - Plan a solution.
    - Break the solution into small parts.
    - Apply the solution.
    - Determine how well the solution solved the problem.

## Humane actions

- [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)
- Win-Win instead of Zero Sum
- Sex SHOULD require consent. Examples of non-consensual sex: Pedophilia, bestiality, rape.
- [Common good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good)
    - [Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)
- The right not to tolerate the intolerant ~ Karl Popper, "The Open Society and Its Enemies" (1945).
- Machine v Garden. Focus on the garden (people, processes, policies), not the machine (hw, code, tech). The machine helps the life in the garden.
- Value > Profit
- Value > Political points
- Rhetoric: inform, persuade, or motivate. Appeal with logos, pathos, and ethos. Use invention, arrangement, style, memory, & delivery.

- [Chivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry). 10 here as well.

## Learning & Teaching

- 10 Kh to become an expert. 20 h to learn. The major barrier to skill isn't intellectual, it's emotional.
    - Get the tools.
    - Deconstruct the skill.
    - Learn enough to self-correct.
    - Remove practice barriers.
    - Practice for at least 20 h to start.
- Training
    - Acknowledge that behaviour is malleable.
    - Associate the behaviour with good things. (Pavlovian)
    - Reward good behaviour.
    - Create an achievable plan to meet goals and determine the most efficient route.
    - End training sessions on a high note.
    - Set things up to be as easy as possible.
    - Train incompatible behaviors to tip the scales towards getting the desired results.
- Study things by analysis (breaking down), then make new things by synthesis.
