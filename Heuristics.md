## 1.1. Epistemology

- How do you know? What do you know?
- "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." ~ Richard Feynman
    - Self candor is difficult.
- Common sense, experimentation, scientific method.
- opinion (_doxa_) v knowledge (_episteme_)
- custom (_nomos_) v nature (_physis_)
- nurture v nature
- perception v knowledge (JTB, verifiability, Gettier problem)
- construct v reality
- Known knowns, known unknowns, unknown knowns, unknown unknowns

## 1.2. Perspective

- If you don't have perspective, then you may just be reacting.
- Effectiveness != Efficacy
- Effectiveness > Efficiency.
    - Safety > Efficiency.
    - Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
- Prioritize
    - Sequence matters. E.g. Recipes follow a sequence.
    - Pareto principle: The vital few with the most ROI
    - The Important & Urgent
        - "I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent." ~ In a 1954 speech to the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches, former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was quoting Dr J. Roscoe Miller, president of Northwestern University, said the above. This "Eisenhower Principle" is said to be how he organized his workload and priorities. Important items contribute to our goals; Urgent items contribute to the goals of others.
        - Important and Urgent. Tasks to DO IMMEDIATELY.
        - Important but not Urgent. Tasks to schedule to DO LATER.
        - Not Important and not Urgent. Tasks to DELEGATE.
        - Not Important and NOT Urgent. Tasks to DELETE.
- The Greek language denotes two distinct principles, [Chronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronos) and [Kairos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos). The former refers to numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally "the right or opportune moment", relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.
- "There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat; And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures." ~ William Shakespeare, "Julius Caesar" (1599), Brutus in scene iii of Act IV.
- "Vita brevis, ars longa, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile." (Latin), "Life is short, the craft long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult." -Hippocrates. First line of "Aphorisms" from the "Hippocratic Corpus".
- Creating > Curating > Collecting > Consuming
- [All the world's a stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world%27s_a_stage). Aka the seven ages of man.
    - Infant
    - Schoolboy
    - Lover
    - Soldier
    - Justice
    - Pantaloon
    - Oblivion
- [Five Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws). Who, What, Why When, Where + How
- Essential > Incidental
    - Essential > Accidental
- Impossible to Possible to Probable to Functional to Perfect
- Build with detail, but feel the dream. Head in the clouds, feet on the ground, heart at hand.
- Strategy. I.e. Look ahead a bit. Win then cut. Go. Rapier.
- [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). Starting with more basic needs
    - Physiological
    - Safety
    - Love and Belonging
    - Esteem. Some insert Cognitive & Aesthetic after Esteem.
    - Self-actualization
    - Self-transcendence

## 1.3. Manage your suffering

- Stoicism. What you can affect.
- Namaste > Living in a world of poison
- Reduce aversion (_dvesha_) 🐍: confusion, drama, discouragement, pracrastination, fear, complaints, angst, feeling sorry for yourself
- Wabi-Sabi: [Imperfect, Incomplete, Impermanent]
- Serenity Prayer

    ```text
    God, grant me
    The serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
    The courage to change the things I can,
    And the wisdom to know the difference.
    ```

- The essence of Zen is non-fixation.
    - Do you have X? Or does X have you?
    - Mindful > Mindless
    - Be present
- Manage your cortisol
- Patient Agent: No fear, no hesitation, no surprise, no doubt. ~ Musashi
- Emotions(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion). Complex but includes the 6 basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.

## 1.4. Manage complexity

- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- 🌱⏳🌳.
- As simple as possible, but no simpler
- Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- You ain't gonna need it (YAGNI). Counter balances too much DRY.
- Don't reinvent the wheel.
- "A journey of a thousand miles begines with a single step.
- Modularity: Large complex wholes can only be actualized, managed, summed, and synergized with small simple parts.
- 1.01^365 = 37.8, i.e. Daily 1% growth results in huge annual growth.
- Analysis & Syntheis
    - E.g. Many mindlessly consider health as binary (healthy or sick), but is actually large & complex, and thus should be broken into smaller and simpler components for analysis. Howwever some focus so much on the analyis that the holistic synthesis is lost.

## Form follows function

- Function is WHAT is to be done or made. Form is HOW it is done or made.
- "Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, form ever follows function, and this is the law. Where function does not change, form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling. It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. This is the law." ~ Louis Sullivan. "The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered" (1896)
- Make either as cannon (done right as has been done before) or as new (done right as has NOT been done before).
- Form follows function as platform follows services.
    - Reversed in [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law): "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."
- Form
    - Typically the emphasis is on Form
    - The form is the shape, pattern, likeness. Forma in Spanish.
    - 道 is Tao or Dao in Chinese; Do in Japanese or Korean. The way, path, route, road, choose, key, principle, doctrine.
    - The form (way, how) can be apolitical and objective, especially if the function (what, why) is effectively not an issue. The form is, of course, subject to forking, but then you have different ways. However regardless of the function , the way it is done maybe in an OK way (do) or in a remarkable way (Do).
        - Generally speaking Do > do and Do has more signal.
    - A structure must exhibit 3 qualities:
        - firmitas, utilitas, venustas
        - solid, useful, beautiful
- Function
    - It is possible to focus on the form regardless of the function (e.g. tea ceremony), but if you can derive more significance from the function, then its signal increases.
    - It is possible to focus on the form so much that it loses connection to its function. E.g. A martial art that becomes a dance; This may be acceptable when done as art for art's sake

## 1.5. Better actions

- Quality. E.g. ISO 9000
- [Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao). 道. Aka Dao, Do. The Way. The "natural order". "This is The Way".
- Growth = Stress + Rest. E.g. PDCA, Kaizen, Virtuous Circle
- (story, struggle) > (excellence, experience)
- Problem Solving:
    - Understand.
    - Plan a solution.
    - Break the solution into small parts.
    - Apply the solution.
    - Determine how well the solution solved the problem.

## 1.6. Humane actions

- [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)
- Win-Win instead of Zero Sum
- Economy of Abundance > Economy of Scarcity. I.e. Generosity > Greed.
- A just and generous well-off society fosters positive subsistence rights
- Sex SHOULD require consent. Examples of non-consensual sex: Pedophilia, bestiality, rape.
- [Common good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good)
    - [Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)
    - Perhaps a good society can provide the basics for its members.
    - If so then what? Food, Water, Shelter, Healthcare, Education, Income, Internet.
    - Provide some conditions. Most parents love and care for their children unconditionally, but as the kids get older, parents tend to alter the care and add conditions. Parents "alter the deal" not because they love their kids less, but because they want to ensure the kids continue developing.
- The right not to tolerate the intolerant ~ Karl Popper, "The Open Society and Its Enemies" (1945).
- Machine v Garden. Focus on the garden (people, processes, policies), not the machine (hw, code, tech). The machine helps the life in the garden.
- Value > Profit
- Value > Political points
- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.

## 1.7. Virtue & Sin

There are many heuristics on [Virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue) and [Sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin). My set is rather arbitrary and arranged by "number".

- [Om](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om). 🕉. The sound of a sacred spiritual symbol in Indian religions, mainly in Hinduism, wherein it signifies the essence of the ultimate reality (_parabrahman_) which is consciousness (_paramatman_). More broadly, it is a syllable that is chanted either independently or before a spiritual recitation in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. E.g. [The Meaning Behind The Om Symbol & Sound, Plus How To Use It Respectfully](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-does-the-om-symbol-mean).
- [Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness).
    - Life. Survival.
    - Liberty. Consent.
    - Happiness. Freedom, Choice.
- [Three poisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_poisons). 3. The three poisons (_trivisa_) of Buddhism are at the root of suffering (_dukkha_) and at the center of the Wheel of Life (_bhavacakra_), i.e. the symbolic representation of cyclic existence (_samsara_). Each is a _klesha_, i.e. a mental state that cloud the mind and manifest in unwholesome actions. These 3 are considered to be the root of all the other _kleshas_. They are the root of _tanha_ (craving), and thus are part of the cause of _dukkha_ (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).
    - _Moha_. Delusion. Confusion. Bewilderment. Ignorance. Chaos. Related to Vanity, Despair, Hubris, & Sloth of the 7 Sins.
        - Represented as a pig 🐖.

    - Justice (δικαιοσύνη, dikaiosynē; iustitia): aka fairness. The most extensive and most important virtue; the Greek word also having the meaning righteousness.    -
    - Aristotle discussed a large variety of virtues in his Nicomachean Ethics and how each had a golden mean as well as a pair of vices if in excess or if deficient. E.g.
        - Courage: The virtue of facing fear and risk.

    - Wealth without work.
    - Pleasure without conscience.
    - Knowledge without character.
    - Commerce without morality.
    - Science without humanity.
    - Religion without sacrifice.
    - Politics without principle.

- [Ten Commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments).
- [Chivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry). 10 here as well.
- Bertrand Russel: "Perhaps the essence of the Liberal outlook could be summed up in a new decalogue, not intended to replace the old one but only to supplement it. The Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate, might be set forth as follows:
    1. Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.
    1. Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.
    1. Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.
    1. When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.
    1. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.
    1. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.
    1. Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.
    1. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.
    1. Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.
    1. Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool’s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.

- [Stoic passions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_passions). Forms of emotional suffering. 4 primary but many subdivisions.
    - Present Delight (_hedone_): Malice, rapture, ostentation
    - Future Lust (_epithumia_): Anger, rage, hatred, enmity, wrath, greed, longing
    - Present Distress (_lupe_): Envy, rivalry, jealousy, compassion, anxiety, mourning, sadness, troubling, grief, lamenting, depression, vexation, despondency
    - Future Fear (_phobos_): Sluggishness, shame, fright, timidity, consternation, pusillanimity, bewilderment, faintheartedness

My favorite is __GRACE__:

- [Courage, Justice, Prudence, Temperance] + [Charity, Faith, Hope] + [Truth, Beauty, Goodness].
- Grace is virtue so elegant, that it seems natural & effortless. The intolerant seek purity, and yet they tarnish themselves because trying to diminish the grace of another diminishes your own grace. Foster grace in others & you foster grace in yourself too.
- Today I dwell on grace. Grace is a combination of elegance and divine blessing. Grace is beauty beyond form that extends into love. Grace is the sound of your child's first cry or your mother's last breath. Grace are creatures or water in any form. Grace ranges from unprocessed nature to the constructs of man. Grace is fairness, respect, and dignity. Grace delights in science that explores the conversion of sunlight into nourishing food. Grace is there in your darkest moments when faith and hope are just pale flickers of light. Grace abounds in your greatest moments when you are shining with hope and love. Grace is mysterious but obvious. Namaste and may the grace of God be with you. ~ Myself

## 1.8. Some Ethics

A spectrum

- Good
    - Survival of yourself or others. E.g. Babies are good. Life.
    - Consent. E.g. A fair trade. Liberty.
    - Love, beauty, and truth. E.g. Teaching. Pursuit of Happiness.
- Indeterminate
    - Stuff beyond good can be hard to judge. E.g. You intended to do good, but did you?
    - Utility and money can be bad measures.
    - Breaking the rules (categorical imperatives, etc) can be bad, but you have to look at the context. E.g. If it was a matter of survival, then breaking the rules may be OK.
- Bad
    - Negating survival. E.g. Harm or undue risk for yourself or others.
    - Negating consent. E.g. Theft.
    - Negating [love, beauty, truth]. E.g. Lying.
- Evil
    - Bad with no excuse of context. E.g. Harm for harm's sake, instead of survival.

Simple rules

- The ends do not justify the means.
- Foster the good & indeterminate, while doing some work to diminish the bad & evil
- Foster processes that favor the good for more people for more time.
- [Local, Tangible] > [Distant, Abstract]. The moral value of an act vs the consequences.

What this model does not cover

- This model does not ask everyone to be a genius saint, but to tend towards good instead of evil.
- This model does not say how to achieve good with efficiency & serenity.
- This model does not specify how to be happy & serene.
- This model does not cover the path to truth & epistemology.
- The moral value of an act vs the consequences.

TODO

- Test my model against a variety of scenarios.
    - Abortion
    - Nazis at your door looking for Jews
    - Trolley problem
    - Immigration
    - Capitalism, Socialism, Politics
    - Incarceration
    - Treatment of non-humans.
- Parse my model against a variety of other models.
- Parse my model against other heuristics.
- Compare to 3 Laws of Robotics

## 1.9. Learning & Teaching

- 10 Kh to become an expert. 20 h to learn. The major barrier to skill isn't intellectual, it's emotional.
    - Get the tools.
    - Deconstruct the skill.
    - Learn enough to self-correct.
    - Remove practice barriers.
    - Practice for at least 20 h to start.
- Training
    - Acknowledge that behaviour is malleable.
    - Associate the behaviour with good things. (Pavlovian)
    - Reward good behaviour.
    - Create an achievable plan to meet goals and determine the most efficient route.
    - End training sessions on a high note.
    - Set things up to be as easy as possible.
    - Train incompatible behaviors to tip the scales towards getting the desired results.
- Study things by analysis (breaking down), then make new things by synthesis.

## 1.10. Social lubrication

- Rhetoric: inform, persuade, or motivate. Appeal with logos, pathos, and ethos. Use invention, arrangement, style, memory, & delivery.
- THINK: Is your communication True, Helpful, Inspiring, Necessary, Kind?
- Although some problems are seemingly solvable and objective, they often have subjective social components.
- Email subjects
    - Verb + Object. E.g: [schedule, view, read, print, sign, scan, return, confirm receipt] + [this, person]. E.g. Call Susan
    - Subject only, i.e. no body. E.g. No text (N/T), End of Message (EOM), No reply necessary (NRN). E.g. \[EOM\] Package received.
