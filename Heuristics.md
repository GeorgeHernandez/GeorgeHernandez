# 1. My Favorite Heuristics

Here are some of my favorite heuristics. A [heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) is any approach to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation. The origin of a heuristic doesn't matter (when, who, where, how, why, etc.), as long as it is helpful. (The curious and intellectually honest should want to dig into the derivation, political context, etc.. If a heuristic isn't helpful, then don't use it.

## 1.1. Epistemology

- How do you know? What do you know?
- "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." ~ Richard Feynman
  - Self candor is difficult.
  - [Cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance). Who would've guessed that our minds are good at rationalizing.
  - "What gets us into trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so." ~ Mark Twain
  - ["I know that I know nothing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing) ~ Plato for Socrates. An answer for why the Oracle of Delphi stated Socrates as the wisest.
  - [Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
- [Common sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense)& [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic). Good but not enough.
  - [Fallacy](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fallacy)
  - [Formal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy)
  - [Cargo cult science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science)
- [Scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method).
  - 'The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific ‚Äútruth‚Äù.' ~ Richard Feynman
  - Key parts of the scientific method
    - Make observations, characterizations
    - Formulate interesting questions.
    - Form Hypotheses
    - Make a testable prediction.
    - Test and experiment. Can the test be repeated? Gather and share the data.
    - Analyze, induce, form general theories.
    - Subject to external and peer review.
  - [Falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability)
  - [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)
- [Johari window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window). Contemporarily used by Donald Rumsfeld when he said ["There are known knowns"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns.)
  - Arena. Known knowns. Perceived by self & others.
  - Blind Spot. Unknown knowns. Not perceived by self, but perceived by others.
  - Fa√ßade. Known unknowns. Not perceived by self, but not perceived by others. This may indicate a conspiracy theory (‚òπÔ∏è) or new knowledge (üòÉ).
  - Unknown. Unknown unknowns. Not perceived by self & others.
- [Nature versus Nurture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture). Especially be wary of indocrination.
  - [_Physis_ (Greek)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physis) v [_Nomos_ (Greek)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomos_(mythology)>)
- [perception, construct] v [knowledge, reality]
  - opinion (_doxa_) v knowledge (_episteme_)
  - [Justified True Belief (JTB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justified_true_belief)
  - [Verificationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism)
  - [Gettier problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem).
  - [Social constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism). Each person creates their own "constructed reality" that drives their behaviors.

## 1.2. Perspective

- If you don't have perspective, then you may just be reacting.
- Effectiveness != Efficacy. Efficacy implies causation proved by deconfounding other variables, whereas effectiveness implies correlation with outcomes regardless of presence of other variables.
- Effectiveness > Efficiency.
  - Effectiveness has different components. E.g. If an exercise is not safe, then it's not effective; hence safety > efficiency. E.g. If a close vote count is not accurate, then it's not effective; hence accuracy > efficiency.
  - Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
  - Within the boundaries of the laws of nature, compliance requirements, etc., you want to balance (freedom, options, creativity, flexibility, efficiency, etc.) against (safety, timeliness, priorities, focus, context, best practices, etc).
- Prioritize
  - Sequence matters. E.g. Recipes follow a sequence.
  - [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). Roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. The vital few with the most ROI.
  - Urgency vs Importance/Impact
    - "I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent." ~ In a 1954 speech to the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches, former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was quoting Dr J. Roscoe Miller, president of Northwestern University, said the above. This "Eisenhower Principle" is said to be how he organized his workload and priorities. Important items contribute to our goals; Urgent items contribute to the goals of others.
      - Important and Urgent. Tasks to DO IMMEDIATELY.
      - Important but not Urgent. Tasks to schedule to DO LATER.
      - Not Important and not Urgent. Tasks to DELEGATE. (This irks me. It sounds like stuff for lowly minions.)
      - Not Important and NOT Urgent. Tasks to DELETE.
    - Another way to say it is that the Priority of an item is roughly the average of its Impact (effect) and Urgency (time).
- Creating > Curating > Collecting > Consuming
- Consumer < Producer < Producers & Consumers collaborating
- [Five Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws). Who, What, Why When, Where + How. Personally what & why are more difficult.
- Essential > Incidental
  - Essential > Accidental
  - The incidentals (language, syntax, domains, problems, people, etc) change, but the essentials (logic, people's nature, principles, problem solving, etc) don't.
- Impossible to Possible to Probable to Functional to Perfect
- Build with detail, but feel the dream. Head in the clouds, feet on the ground, heart at hand.
- Construct life like a story but live it like a dream.
- [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy). I.e. Look ahead a bit. Win then cut (instead of just striking hoping to win). Go. Rapier.
- [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). Starting with more basic needs
  - Physiological
  - Safety
  - Love and Belonging
  - Esteem. Some insert Cognitive & Aesthetic after Esteem.
  - Self-actualization
  - Self-transcendence
- [Risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management). Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks (defined in ISO 31000 as the effect of uncertainty on objectives) followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities.
- [Physicists Have Discovered a Formula for Success, and It Contains a Brutal Truth Most People Don't Want to Admit](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/physicists-have-discovered-a-formula-for-success-it-contains-a-brutal-truth-most-people-dont-want-to-admit.html)
  - Success = (Ability to execute ) \* (potential value of an idea).

## 1.3. WHO

- [Grammatical person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person)
  - 1st person singular: I. Me. Us.
  - 1st person plural: We.
  - 2nd person singular: You. Thee. Thou.
  - 2nd person plural: Ye. Y'all. You guys. Yinz. Youse.
  - 3rd person singular: He. She. It.
  - 3rd person plural: They. Them
- Loved ones.
- Those in need.
- Those to come.
- Those who are unehard, have no voice.
- Those you are grateful for or to.
- Your heroes. Do they inspire you to act?
- Not typically people: Non-life (e.g. rocks), non-sentients (e.g plants), non-humans (e.g. animals, aliens, artifiical life forms), etc.
- Talk to a variety of folks by age, gender, class, occupation, outlook, etc.

## 1.4. WHEN

- Time and Date Standard: [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` and `P3DT2H`. http://xkcd.com/1179/. I wonder if `2019\10\03-24` would have been better?
- Time is finite
- How long? How often?
- Time is always flowing
- Timing
  - If you're going to fail, fail fast.
  - Lots of timing in martial arts. True time as per [George Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Silver). _Vor_ and _noch_ of the [German schol of fencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_school_of_fencing). And so on.
  - "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven" ~ [Ecclesiastes 3](https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3.htm).
  - [Procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination) is often not about time but about emotional suffering. Procrastinating, urfing, lounging, chilling, etc. can alleviate suffering. You have to determine need (v want) and whether you have the time for it now (v later).
  - Timing & priorities can be linked. E.g. People ofen say "pay yourself first" (with savings, debt reduction, etc), but the same applies for time, i.e. you need to set aside some time for exercise, hygiene, mental health, relaxation, exploing, being lively, etc.
  - Be mindful of the ebb and flow of your physical & mental energy throughout the day or week. E.g. The [daily quadrants](https://www.fastcompany.com/90742937/how-to-use-daily-quadrants-to-get-more-done-each-day) method has a typical day as
    - pt2h High Intensity & High Impact. Your most important work.
    - pt2h High Intensity & Low Impact. Smaller items.
    - pt2h Low Intensity & Low Impact. Post-lunch coma, thus emails, filing, etc.
    - pt2h Low Intensity & High Impact. Wrap up, plan for the next day, so you can hit the ground running.
    - If you are not a morning person, you may want to a different schedule.
- Past
  - "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards." ~ S√∏ren Kierkegaard
  - "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." ~ George Santayana
- Present
  - _Carpe Diem_: Seize the day
  - The Greek language denotes two distinct principles, [Chronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronos) and [Kairos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos). The former refers to numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally "the right or opportune moment", relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.
  - "There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat; And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures." ~ William Shakespeare, "Julius Caesar" (1599), Brutus in scene iii of Act IV.
- Future

  - [Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny)
  - [Wyrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyrd)

- "Vita brevis, ars longa, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile." (Latin), "Life is short, the craft long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult." -Hippocrates. First line of "Aphorisms" from the "Hippocratic Corpus".
- "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." ~ Gandhi
- [All the world's a stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world%27s_a_stage). Aka the seven ages of man.
  - Infant
  - Schoolboy
  - Lover
  - Soldier
  - Justice
  - Pantaloon
  - Oblivion
- ["This too shall pass"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_too_shall_pass)
- ["Ozymandias"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias) by English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.

## 1.5. Goals (WHAT/WHY)

- Greek Aristotle's [_Telos_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos) (end, goal). Japanese [_Ikigai_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) (reason for being) Áîü„ÅçÁî≤Êñê. French _raison d'√™tre_ (reason to be).

  - Distractions include many variants like the following:

    ```text
    Finger     : Moon  ::
    Money      : Value ::
    Techne     : Telos ::
    Busywork   : Work  ::
    Incidental : Essential
    ```

  - The adages about Losing our [Way, Perspective, Ithaca, Shire, Camelot]. Matthew 5:3-16 with the Beatitudes, Salt of the Earth, Light of the World, City upon a Hill, etc. are about _moranthe_ (losing flavor, becoming foolish) ŒºœâœÅŒ±ŒΩŒ∏·øáson, i.e. humility not hubris.

- [Meaning-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning-making). In psychology, meaning-making is the process of how people construe, understand, or make sense of life events, relationships, and the self.
- The adage is "You are what you do", but consider being your best self and let your nature drive what you do.
- [Satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing). A decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met. E.g. A task is to sew a patch onto a pair of blue pants. The best needle to do the threading is a 4-cm-long needle with a 3-millimeter eye. This needle is hidden in a haystack along with 1,000 other needles varying in size from 1 cm to 6 cm. Satisficing claims that the first needle that can sew on the patch is the one that should be used. Spending time searching for that one specific needle in the haystack is a waste of energy and resources.
- [Flow](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>). Aka being in the zone. A mental state in whicha person performing some activity is fully immeresed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyjment in the process of the activity. Voluntary challenging worthwhile activities. Neither unchallenging (boring) or too challenging (crushing).

## 1.6. Manage your suffering (HOW)

- [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism). What you can affect. The facts, events, outcomes, etc. may differ from your expectations.
- [_Namaste_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste) > Living in a world of poison.
- Reduce aversion (_dvesha_) üêç: confusion, drama, discouragement, pracrastination, fear, complaints, angst, feeling sorry for yourself
- [Wabi-Sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi): [Imperfect, Incomplete, Impermanent]
  - Some things must be "perfect". E.g. 1 + 1 = 2. However it is too much to expect a full, deep, totally refreshing night's sleep every night. Over achievement, self realization, perfection, 100%, etc. are overrated. Things like better, above average, etc. can also be too much. I think things like settling, managing expectations, etc. are keys to achieving happiness. It is yet another take on Stoicism, the Serenity Prayer, etc.
- [Serenity Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer)

  ```text
  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
  The courage to change the things I can,
  And the wisdom to know the difference.
  ```

- The essence of [Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) is non-fixation.
  - Do you have X? Or does X have you?
  - Mindful > Mindless
  - Be present
- Be a Patient Agent.
- "No fear, no hesitation, no surprise, no doubt." ~ Musashi
- [Emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion). Complex but includes the 6 basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.
- [Rational emotive behavior therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy) Aka REBT or A-B-C-D-E-F model.
  - A stands for Activating Event or Adversity. This is any event. It is just a fact. E.g. Traffic.
  - B refers to one's irrational Belief about the event at "A". Look for beliefs with these troublesome words such as should, ought and must. E.g. "Traffic shouldn't be this bad."
  - C stands for the emotional and behavioral Consequences. E.g. You banging the steering wheel with your fist and sending your blood pressure into the stratosphere.
  - D stands for Disputes or arguments against irrational beliefs. E.g. Are you demanding the universe and everyone bend to your wishes? Is that rational? No way. You can want, you can wish and you can definitely try your best in the future, but you cannot demand if you want to stay happy and sane.
  - E stands for new Effect or the new, more Effective emotions and behaviors that result from more reasonable thinking about the original event. E.g. Accept traffic as it is.
  - F stands for the developed Feelings. E.g. Inner peace.
- There are so called "secrets" that you might share. There are real secrets you never will.
- Mental distance & perspective.
  - Zoom in on the good. Immerse yourself in it, relish it, cherish it. Be grateful for the good.
  - Zoom out of the bad. Be more objectve. What if it was someone else that had your problems? Use your anger, fear, sadness, worry, frustration, etc. to take positive action. Step out into nature or big picture views/shows.
- Get help. Sometimes you need extra tools, people, time, space, etc to solve things.

## 1.7. Manage complexity (HOW)

- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- üå±‚è≥üå≥.
  - Start small and over time produce results.
  - 1.01^365 = 37.8, i.e. Daily 1% growth results in huge annual growth.
  - "Every journey begins with a single step." ~ Laozi in Tao Te Ching
  - Keep your to do list small. Large to do lists are often lists of things you are never going to do.
- As simple as possible, but no simpler.
  - [Perfect is the enemy of good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good)
  - As simple as possible (as per natural law, laws of man, compliance, etchics, not being a jackass, etc), but no simpler.
- Don't reinvent the wheel.
- [Programming principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles). Many of these apply to regular life. Here are some favorites:
  - [Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
  - [Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
  - [You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it). Counter balances too much DRY.
  - [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
  - [Modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity): Large complex wholes can only be actualized, managed, summed, and synergized with small simple parts.
    - [Coupling (computer programming)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)>). Usually loose coupling (interdependence on other modules) is preferred.
    - [Cohesion (computer science)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)>). Usually high cohesion (the degree to which elements belong together within a module) is preferred.
- Analysis & Syntheis
  - Many mindlessly consider health as binary (healthy or sick), but is actually large & complex, and thus should be broken into smaller and simpler components for analysis. Howwever some focus so much on the analyis that the holistic synthesis is lost.
  - Analysis might separate "means to an end" as how v why, but synthesis can say that the journey and the goal are one.
  - We construct in the present, but hindsight comes from deconstructing the past.
- [Self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization). The topic itself is fascinating but note that it is not a matter of either self-organing or centrally-organized. Why not both? Why not a body with self-organizing cells & a centrally-organizing brain? Why not grass roots & executive functionality?
- [Complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system)
- [Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal). The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975. The topic itself is fascinating but I like to apply the concept generally in this fashion: Managable sytems have similarities regardless of the size & type of the system even though the specifics at each zoom & domain differ. E.g. Managing the health of 3, 30, 300, 3e3, 3e6, 300e6, 7e9.
- [Power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)

## 1.8. Form follows function (HOW/WHAT)

- Function is WHAT is to be done or made. Form is HOW it is done or made.
- "Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, form ever follows function, and this is the law. Where function does not change, form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling. It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. This is the law." ~ Louis Sullivan. "The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered" (1896)
- Make either as cannon (done right as has been done before) or as new (done right as has NOT been done before).
- Form follows function as platform follows services.
  - Reversed in [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law): "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."
- Form
  - Typically the emphasis is on Form
  - The form is the shape, pattern, likeness. Forma in Spanish.
  - ÈÅì is Tao or Dao in Chinese; Do in Japanese or Korean. The way, path, route, road, choose, key, principle, doctrine.
  - The form (way, how) can be apolitical and objective, especially if the function (what, why) is effectively not an issue. The form is, of course, subject to forking, but then you have different ways. However regardless of the function , the way it is done maybe in an OK way (do) or in a remarkable way (Do).
    - Generally speaking: Do > do; Do has more signal.
  - A structure must exhibit 3 qualities:
    - firmitas, utilitas, venustas
    - solid, useful, beautiful
- Function
  - It is possible to focus on the form regardless of the function (e.g. tea ceremony), but if you can derive more significance from the function, then its signal increases.
  - It is possible to focus on the form so much that it loses connection to its function. E.g. A martial art that becomes a dance; This may be acceptable when done as art for art's sake.
- PP: Policies and Procedures
  - Organizations that follow a process approach implment policies and procedures.
    - Purpose. WHY.
    - Policy. WHAT.
    - Procedures. General HOW.
    - Processes. Specific HOW.

## 1.9. Better actions (HOW)

- Quality. E.g. [ISO 9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9000): Customer focus, Leadership, Engagement of people, Process approach, Improvement, Evidence-based decision making, Relationhip management.
- Growth = Stress + Rest. E.g. PDCA, Kaizen, Virtuous Circle
- Nature to be commanded must be obeyed ~ Francis Bacon, "Novum Organum" (The New Organon) (1620). Probblems can be better solved if you have a better understanding of the situation and deal with the factors involved. In swordsmanship the path to your opponent is through their sword, i.e. if you don't manage their sword and just try to hit them, then you may get hit yourself.
- (story, struggle) > (excellence, experience)
- Problem Solving. E.g. [How to Solve It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It) by George P√≥lya:
  - Understand the problem
  - Devise a plan/solution
    - Break the solution into small parts.
  - Carry out the plan.
  - Review/extend. Determine how well the solution solved the problem. Extend it to future problems.
- [Wicked problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem)
- Meetings
  - Consider NOT having a meeting. Sometimes alternatives like an email or a phone call will do. Sometimes gravitas requires a meetings.
  - Be mindful of the person-hours each meeting takes. E.g. A 2 hour meeting with 4 people takes at least 8 person-hours. There may be additional person-hours via opportunity cost, commuting, etc.
  - Make meetings more efficient
    - Have someone lead or moderate the meeting.
    - Start by stating the time frame, purpose, key contact info, breaks, availability of recordings/notes, etc.
    - Account for bio breaks for using the restroom, nourishment, stretching, etc.
  - Meeting should be recorded or someone should take notes. Somtimes it is helpful take notes that the people can see so that there is no doubt about what was communicated.
  - Start meetings a bit later than the stated time because there are always late comers. Plus people can set an alarm for the stated time and still be on time for virtual meetings.
  - End meetings a bit earlier than the stated time.
  - Discussions that are not strictly on the agenda for all attendees should be reserved for sidebars, later meetings, etc.

## 1.10. Humane actions (HOW/WHY)

- [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)
  - Sex SHOULD require consent. Examples of non-consensual sex: Pedophilia, bestiality, rape. Consent FRIES: Freely given, Reversible, Informed, Enthusiastic, Specific.
- Win-Win instead of Zero Sum
  - Value > Profit. Folks are sometimes so concerned with profit that they provide negative value.
  - Value > Political points. Folks are sometimes so concerned with winning that they provide negative value.
  - Economy of Abundance > Economy of Scarcity. I.e. Generosity > Greed.
  - A just and generous well-off society fosters positive subsistence rights
  - We may all live in our own constructed realities, but instead of siloing & diminishing others, why build up everyone's that we can?
- [Common good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good)
  - [Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)
  - Perhaps a good society can provide the basics for its members.
  - If so then what? Food, Water, Shelter, Healthcare, Education, Income, Internet.
  - Provide some conditions. Most parents love and care for their children unconditionally, but as the kids get older, parents tend to alter the care and add conditions. Parents "alter the deal" not because they love their kids less, but because they want to ensure the kids continue developing.
- The right not to tolerate the intolerant ~ Karl Popper, "The Open Society and Its Enemies" (1945).
- Machine v Garden. Focus on the garden (people, processes, policies), not the machine (hw, code, tech). The machine helps the life in the garden.
- Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Share, Recycle.
- A government can be a Theocracy or a Democracy, but not both.
- [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy)
- Action & words can persist in many ways. They impress in your psyche and the psyche of others. They manifest as memories, dreams, echoes, ghosts, and so on. You should act and speak such that your psychic impression is postive and good. Will you persist as a friend, a hero, a pleasant dream, an angel? Or will you persist as an enemy, a villain, a nightmare, a demon?

## 1.11. Virtue & Sin (HOW)

There are many heuristics on [Virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue) and [Sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin). My set is rather arbitrary and arranged by "number".

- [_Om_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om). üïâ. The sound of a sacred spiritual symbol in Indian religions, mainly in Hinduism, wherein it signifies the essence of the ultimate reality (_parabrahman_) which is consciousness (_paramatman_). More broadly, it is a syllable that is chanted either independently or before a spiritual recitation in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. E.g. [The Meaning Behind The Om Symbol & Sound, Plus How To Use It Respectfully](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-does-the-om-symbol-mean).

Each is a _klesha_, i.e. a mental state that cloud the mind and manifest in unwholesome actions. These 3 are considered to be the root of all the other _kleshas_. They are the root of [_tanha_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81) (craving), and thus are part of the cause of [_dukkha_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%E1%B8%A5kha) (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).

- [Chivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry). 10 here as well.
- Bertrand Russel: "Perhaps the essence of the Liberal outlook could be summed up in a new decalogue, not intended to replace the old one but only to supplement it. The Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate, might be set forth as follows:
  1. Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.
  2. Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.
  3. Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.
  4. When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.
  5. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.
  6. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.
  7. Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.
  8. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.
  9. Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.
  10. Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool‚Äôs paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.

- [Delphic maxims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphic_maxims). 147 cited by Stobaeus; 3 inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi:
  - ŒìŒΩ·ø∂Œ∏Œπ œÉŒµŒ±œÖœÑœåŒΩ. Know thyself. In Latin: _nosce te ipsum_ or _temet nosce_. I.e. Introspection.
  - ŒúŒ∑Œ¥·Ω≤ŒΩ ·ºÑŒ≥Œ±ŒΩ. Nothing in excess. I.e. Temperance.
  - ·ºòŒ≥Œ≥œçŒ± œÄŒ¨œÅŒ± Œ¥ ·ºÑœÑŒ±. Surety brings ruin. I.e. Pride.
- [Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching) (ÈÅìÂæ∑Á∂ì) by Laozi (ËÄÅÂ≠ê). Sort of misfiled here but its short and deep. Some of my favorite items
  - "The tao that can be described is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be spoken is not the eternal Name.". One interpretation is try to understand instead of blindly following dogma or formulas.
  - "When goodness is lost there is morality.". Dogma.
  - "If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich. "
  - "Every journey begins with a single step."
  - "Not-knowing is true knowledge. Presuming to know is a disease. First realize that you are sick; then you can move toward health."
  - "I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion."
  - "The path into the light seems dark, the path forward seems to go back, the direct path seems long."
  - "The truth is not always beautiful, nor beautiful words the truth."
  - "A leader is best When people barely know he exists Of a good leader, who talks little, When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, They will say, 'We did this ourselves.'"

My favorite is **GRACE**:

- [Courage, Justice, Prudence, Temperance] + [Charity, Faith, Hope] + [Truth, Beauty, Goodness].
- Grace is virtue so elegant, that it seems natural & effortless. The intolerant seek purity, and yet they tarnish themselves because trying to diminish the grace of another diminishes your own grace. Foster grace in others & you foster grace in yourself too.
- Today I dwell on grace. Grace is a combination of elegance and divine blessing. Grace is beauty beyond form that extends into love. Grace is the sound of your child's first cry or your mother's last breath. Grace are creatures or water in any form. Grace ranges from unprocessed nature to the constructs of man. Grace is fairness, respect, and dignity. Grace delights in science that explores the conversion of sunlight into nourishing food. Grace is there in your darkest moments when faith and hope are just pale flickers of light. Grace abounds in your greatest moments when you are shining with hope and love. Grace is mysterious but obvious. Namaste and may the grace of God be with you. ~ Myself

## 1.12. Some Ethics (HOW)

A spectrum:

- Good
  - Survival of yourself or others. E.g. Babies are good. Life.
  - Consent. E.g. A fair trade. Liberty.
  - Love, beauty, and truth. E.g. Teaching. Pursuit of Happiness.
- Indeterminate
  - Stuff beyond good can be hard to judge. E.g. You intended to do good, but did you?
  - Utility and money can be bad measures.
  - Breaking the rules (categorical imperatives, etc) can be bad, but you have to look at the context. E.g. If it was a matter of survival, then breaking the rules may be OK.
- Bad
  - Negating survival. E.g. Harm or undue risk for yourself or others.
  - Negating consent. E.g. Theft.
  - Negating [love, beauty, truth]. E.g. Lying.
- Evil
  - Bad with no excuse of context. E.g. Harm for harm's sake, instead of survival.

Simple rules

- The ends do not justify the means.
- Foster the good & indeterminate, while doing some work to diminish the bad & evil
- Foster processes that favor the good for more people for more time.
- [Local, Tangible] > [Distant, Abstract]. The moral value of an act vs the consequences. Who is most responsible for those nearest to you?

What this model does not cover

- This model does not ask everyone to be a genius saint, but to tend towards good instead of evil.
- This model does not say how to achieve good with efficiency & serenity.
- This model does not specify how to be happy & serene.
- This model does not cover the path to truth & epistemology.
- The moral value of an act vs the consequences.

TODO

- Test my model against a variety of scenarios.
  - Abortion
  - Nazis at your door looking for Jews
  - Trolley problem
  - Immigration
  - Capitalism, Socialism, Politics
  - Incarceration
  - Treatment of non-humans.
- Parse my model against a variety of other models.
- Parse my model against other heuristics.
- Compare to 3 Laws of Robotics

## 1.13. Learning & Teaching (HOW)

- 10 Kh to become an expert. 20 h to learn. The major barrier to skill isn't intellectual, it's emotional.
  - Get the tools.
  - Deconstruct the skill.
  - Learn enough to self-correct.
  - Remove practice barriers.
  - Practice for at least 20 h to start.
- Training
  - Acknowledge that behaviour is malleable.
  - Associate the behaviour with good things. (Pavlovian)
  - Reward good behaviour.
  - Create an achievable plan to meet goals and determine the most efficient route.
  - End training sessions on a high note.
  - Set things up to be as easy as possible.
  - Train incompatible behaviors to tip the scales towards getting the desired results.
- Study things by analysis (breaking down), then make new things by synthesis.

## 1.14. Social lubrication (HOW)

- Rhetoric: inform, persuade, or motivate. Appeal with logos, pathos, and ethos. Use invention, arrangement, style, memory, & delivery.
- THINK: Is your communication True, Helpful, Inspiring, Necessary, Kind?
- Although some problems are seemingly solvable and objective, they often have subjective social components.
- [BLUF: Bottom line up front](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)>). Start messages with the key info. E.g. Start with a summary or TLDNR.
- Email subjects
  - Verb + Object. E.g: [schedule, view, read, print, sign, scan, return, confirm receipt] + [this, person]. E.g. Call Susan
  - Subject only, i.e. no body. E.g. No text (N/T), End of Message (EOM), No reply necessary (NRN). E.g. \[EOM\] Package received.
- Apply OOP broadly: There are classes & object instances with properties, methods, interfaces, input, output, etc. The context matters. We rewrite our own human programming.
- Influence without authority.
  - You can't do everything.
  - You're not the boss of everyone.
  - People are part of nature too: Nature to be commanded must be obeyed ~ Francis Bacon, "Novum Organum" (The New Organon) (1620).
- Sometimes it is better to err on the side of over communcation.
- "The Success Indicator Acceleration Report" by MaryEllen Tribby
  - Compliment > Criticize
  - Forgive others > Hold a grudge
  - Accept responsibility for their failures > Blame others for their failures
  - Keep a journal > Say they keep a journal but really don't
  - Want others to succeed > Secretly hope others fail
  - Keep a "to be" list > Don't know what they want to be
  - Set goals and develop life plans > Never set goals
  - Continuously learn > Think they know it all
  - Operate from a transformational perspective > Operate from a transactional perspective
  - Keep a "to do/project" list > Fly by the seat of their pants
  - Embrace change > Fear change
  - Exude joy > Exude anger
  - Share information and data > Horde information and data
  - Talk about ideas > Talk about people
  - Read everyday > Watch TV everyday
  - Give other people credit for their victories > Take all the credit of the their victories
  - Have a sense of gratitude > Have a sense of entitlement
- In one definition "politics" is protecting & promoting your interests, thus everyone should be involved in politics.
