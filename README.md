# Hello, world! 👋 🌎

My name is George Hernandez and I live in Chicago. I work as Lead Full Stack Engineer at [XIL Health](https://xilhealth.com) in the healthcare industry there. (Yes, it's a [Yon Yonson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yon_Yonson) reference.)

I am a calm, candid, cozy, & curious canid🦊 who strives to be a courageous, creative, & kind contributor. 🦊The fox is my spirit animal: I identify as a hidden forest creature. How do you know? How can you know? Let's test it out. Let's be effective & efficient but manage our suffering as we do it.
