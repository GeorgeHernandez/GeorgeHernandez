# Hello, world! 👋 🌎

My name is George Hernandez and I live in Chicago.

This repository was originally a brief "About Me". However, I love exploring and sharing. What & how I share also tells you about me.

🦊The fox is my spirit animal: I identify as a hidden forest creature. I am a calm, candid, cozy, & curious canid who strives to be a courageous, creative, & kind contributor. How do you know? How can you know? Let's test it out. Let's be effective & efficient but let's communicate & manage our suffering as we do it.

There's my [[Log]] 🪵, which should be largely point-in-time content, then there's content that I intend to edit as needed over time, and have categorized as follows:

- [[Cognition]] 🦉. Pertains to the mind, STEM, prudence, etc.
- [[Courage]] 🦁. Pertains to the body, martial arts, exercise, etc.
- [[Culture]] 🕊️. Pertains to the spirit, worldviews, justice, etc.
- [[Log]] 🪵. Largely point-in-time content, that I shouldn't edit.
- [[My]] 🦊. Stuff particularly "About Me".
- [[zEtc]] 📤. Stuff that doesn't fit neatly into my schema.
