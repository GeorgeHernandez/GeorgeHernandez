### Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒŽ

My name is George Hernandez and I live in Chicago, Illinois.

I work as Chief of Applications at [Roji Health Intelligence](https://rojihealthintelligence.com) in the healthcare industry.

I am a calm, candid, & curious cat who strives to be a courageous, creative, & kind contributor.

We all have different experiences, paths, heuristics, histories, futures, context, etc., and yet there is also so much in common that sharing makes all of us better.

Policy affects many of us (the *polis*) and thus we need to make those decisions together, preferably using best practices, evidence, well formed logic, transparency, testing, etc., but also in an effective, timely, earnest, heard, woke, and emotionally conscious manner.
