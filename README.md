# Hello, world! 👋 🌎

My name is George Hernandez and I live in Chicago. I work as Chief of Applications at [Roji Health Intelligence](https://rojihealthintel.com) in the healthcare industry there. (Yes, it's a [Yon Yonson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yon_Yonson) reference.)

🐈 I am a calm, candid, & curious cat who strives to be a courageous, creative, & kind contributor. How do you know? How can you know? Let's test it out. Let's be effective & efficient but manage our suffering as we do it.

🦊 I am usually quiet but I will share a few things:

- ✨ [Stuff I find wonderful](Wonderful.md)
- 💬 [My favorite quotes](Quotes.md)
- 🌱 [My favorite heuristics](Heuristics.md)
- 🤌🏽 [My opinions](Opinions.md)
