# Hello, world! 👋 🌎

This repository was originally a brief "About Me". However, I love exploring and sharing. What & how I share also tells you about me.

My name is George Hernandez and I live in Chicago.

🦊The fox is my spirit animal: I identify as a hidden forest creature. I am a calm, candid, cozy, & curious canid who strives to be a courageous, creative, & kind contributor. How do you know? How can you know? Let's test it out. Let's be effective & efficient but let's communicate & manage our suffering as we do it.
