# Hello, world! 👋 🌎

My name is George Hernandez and I live in Chicago. This repository was originally a brief "About Me". But it has grown since I love exploring & sharing. What & how I share also tells you about me.

My content is categorized as follows:

- [[AboutMe|About Me]] 🦊. Stuff particularly "About Me".
- [[Cognition]] 🦉. Pertains to the mind, STEM, prudence, etc.
- [[Courage]] 🦁. Pertains to the body, martial arts, exercise, etc.
- [[Culture]] 🕊️. Pertains to the spirit, worldviews, justice, etc.
- [[Log]] 🪵. Largely point-in-time content, that I shouldn't edit.
- [[zEnd]] 📤. Stuff that doesn't fit neatly into my schema.

FYI about this repo:

- This repo is publicly shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/) but is better viewed with the Obsidian app.
