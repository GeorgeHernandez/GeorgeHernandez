# Hello, world üëã üåé

My name is George Hernandez and I live in Chicago.

My content is categorized as follows:
- [[AboutMe|About Me]] ü¶ä. Stuff particularly "About Me".
- [[Cognition]] ü¶â. The mind, STEM, prudence, etc.
- [[Courage]] ü¶Å. The body, martial arts, exercise, etc.
- [[Culture]] üïäÔ∏è. The spirit, worldviews, justice, etc.
- [[Log]] ü™µ. Largely point-in-time content, that I shouldn't edit later. (If I do it will show in the Git commit log.)
- [[zEnd]] üì§. Stuff that doesn't fit neatly into my schema.

## About this Repo

This repo has several functions:
- It's an "About Me" for George Hernandez.
- It's a public repository of notes by George Hernandez.
- It's a public web log (blog) by George Hernandez.

This repo is currently made with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and is best viewed with Obsidian, but it can also be viewed and navigated at [GitHub](https://github.com/) without Obsidian. This repo was previously written mainly in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Site Conventions

Conventions I tend to follow on this site.

[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for dates, etc. I may get lazy with UPPERCASING it.
- Dates. E.g. `2025-01-13`.
- Times. E.g. `14:40`.
- Interval periods. E.g. `P15DT7H`.
- Recurring intervals. E.g. `R/2025-01-13/P2W`.
- See also http://xkcd.com/1179/.

[Engineering notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_notation) for some numbers. E.g. Instead of 3 million, I will say 3e6.

Metric ([SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units)), but I will occasionally use pounds (lbs, #), miles, and F. I change 3 prefixes:
    ```yaml
    [da, h, k, M, G,  T,  P,  E,  Z,  Y,  R,  Q] to:
    [ D, H, K, M, G,  T,  P,  E,  Z,  Y,  R,  Q]. e:
    [ 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
    ```

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" MAY BE interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). Aka Conformance Verbs for Requirement Levels.

Double dot notation for [cardinality requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_(data_modeling)). E.g. To specify that set has 1 to 3 items, I would denote it as `1..3`.

Two spaces (`  `) for indentation when writing about code, unless the system requires otherwise. 4 spaces looks better, hard tabs can be adjusted, but if you have to hand type code and hard tabs are not available, then 2 spaces is what works.

The [Latin abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_abbreviations) I tend to use most often:
- `ca.`. *circa*. "around".
- `e.g.`. *exempli gratia*. "for example". Mnemonic: "example given".
- `et al.`. *et alii*. "and others". E.g. Kili, Fili, et al.
- `etc`. *et cetera*. "and the others"
-  `i.e.`.  *id est*. "that is".
- `ibid.` *ibidem*. "in the same place". The same citation as the previoius.

Tables are prefixed with "**Table:**" followed by a description. Similarly figures are prefixed with "**Figure:**" followed by a description. I may yet apply tags to figures and tables.

[APA style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APA_style) for citations and references.

`zEnd` as a header for miscellaneous items. I pronounce as /zee end/ because it's a play on "the end". It's a convention from sorting a spreadsheet by type and I want to `zEnd` to be the last type. Nearing the end is often an achievement to be celebrated.
