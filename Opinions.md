# 1. My Opinions

Here are some of my opinions to express myself in my own idiom and to make a minor contribution to society. I'll start with my opinion on opinions, then provide some of my opinions, starting with some easy ones.

## 1.1. My opinions on opinions

Your opinions and worldview will almost certainly differ from mine. And yet we have so much in common that it is important to be able to share and parse our opinions so as to have informed, tested, reviewed, & overall improved opinions.

- LOGIC. Given the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) and the [fact-value distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact%E2%80%93value_distinction), ought/value opinions may not be purely derived from facts or what-is. Even so we all form opinions. If however I present a proposition with a [formal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy), then I apologize and should appreciate having it pointed out to me.
- FACTS. These should be reasonably independent of belief. The blur between [facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact) and [opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion) is astonishing. Is it possible to have all the facts? Do you know all the facts about your father? Education varies: Some people with no formal education may have a better set of facts; Two people can go to the same classes and come out with different facts. If my opinions are missing key facts, then I should appreciate being informed of the facts. Besides fact v opinion, I like facts & opinions, i.e. the facts and the fancy can coexist.
- EXPERIMENTS. The scientific method has been Man's best tool for coming up with positive facts. However it needs a creative hypothesis (i.e. an opinion) that can be tested and reviewed. Similarly a person's character may just be bluster if never tested.
- DEFINITIONS. Some definitions are merely tautologies or language-games (Wittgenstein) and should be taken with a grain of salt. I may provide definitions that are convenient or context specific, and thus may vary from the vernacular or more proper definitions or standards. Definitions, like axioms, are in effect opinions upon which you build propositions or other opinions.
- EXPERIENCES. First hand anecdotal experiences are facts but, like facts, come in a great variety. Experiences can strongly color opinions and it is good to be aware of that. Also memory is often a fickle thing.
- QUOTES. These are often succinct and witty, but also provide other perspectives, other opinions.
- HEURISTICS. While not optimal, perfect, or rational, heuristics are often satisfactory and are an opinion shared by many. I will strive to generate a small set of common sense, secular heuristics that can be used as axioms to apply broadly. A heuristic must be helpful, otherwise it is noise, like a bad tradition.
- METAPHORS. Metaphors are great because they take something we already know and carry them forward to something else.
- PERSPECTIVE: Opinions vary in different points in our lives, contexts, etc.

### 1.1.1. Bonus: Some quotes on facts & opinions

"You can spend your whole life building a wall of facts between you and anything real." - Chuck Palahniuk

"The truth is more important than the facts." - Frank Lloyd Wright

"We do not deal much in facts when we are contemplating ourselves." - Mark Twain

"Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are incapable of forming such opinions." - Albert Einstein

'Experiment is the sole judge of scientific "truth".' - Richard Feynman

"Why, you simple creatures, the weakest of all weak things is a virtue which has not been tested in the fire." - Mark Twain

## 1.2. SHOULD

### 1.2.1. Best

- Time and Date Standard: [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` and `P3DT2H`. http://xkcd.com/1179/. I wonder if `2019\10\03-24` would have been better?
- System of Measurement: Metric. However I have a few personal opinions.

  - The prefixes for the positive exponents SHOULD change from:

    ```yaml
    [da, h, k, M, G,  T,  P,  E,  Z,  Y,  R,  Q] to:
    [ D, H, K, M, G,  T,  P,  E,  Z,  Y,  R,  Q]. e:
    [ 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
    ```

  - The prefixes for the negative exponents are fine. ISO 2955 was on track: µ isn't ASCII but it's easy to enter with a keyboard input like EN INTL.

    ```yaml
    [d, c, m, μ, n,  p,  f,  a,  z,  y,  r,  q]. e-:
    [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
    ```

- Browser: Google Chrome. Best by largest number of users and if you use multiple Google accounts. Microsoft Edge uses less memory and has vertical tabbing.

### 1.2.2. Better

- Breastfeeding > Formula
- Toilet rolls releasing from the top > bottom
- A4 paper (ISO 216) > 8.5"x11"
- Common Era (CE) > AD
- Butter > Margarine
- Languages with few characters > 100s of characters
- LibreOffice > Open Office. LO can incorporate features from OO, but not the other way. LO has ~50x as many users.
- Renewable & Reusable > Single use
- Period (`.`) > Comma (`,`). For use as a decimal character, the period is simpler. It's right there on the numeric keypad.
- Wheelbarrow with centrally-mounted wheel > end-mounted wheel

### 1.2.3. Good

- Because of the [oligodynamic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligodynamic_effect), it would be nice if some germ-exposed items were made out of naturally biocidal metals. E.g. Brass doorknobs, silverware.
- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" MAY BE interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). Aka Conformance Verbs for Requirement Levels.
- ISO 9000: 7 Quality Management Principles: Customer Focus. Leadership. Engagement of People. Process Approach. Improvement. Evidence-Based Decision Making. Relationship Management.
- 13 month calendars where each month is 28 day. E.g. [International Fixed Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar) or [Positivist calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivist_calendar). Alas, not likely to ever be broadly implemented.

## 1.3. SHOULD CSE

### 1.3.1. Best

- Unicode Encoding: UTF-8, which is Windows Code Page Identifier 65001.
- Version Control: Git
- Indentation: 2 spaces, unless your system requires it.
- Web Service: REST Web API
- Wikipedia is awesome!
- Parks, especially national and state parks are awesome!
- Public libraries are awesome!

### 1.3.2. Better

- Floating Point Marker > Comma
- TOML > YAML > JSON > XML
- `!=` > `<>`
- 1 space between sentences > 2 spaces. Exceptions: You have been wired by typewriter classes or your system requires otherwise (e.g. Linux `fmt -u`).
- HTML > XHTML
- My physical keyboard preferences:
  - Layout: US QWERTY with at least 104 keys. The bottom row: ctrl, win, alt, space, alt gr, win, menu, ctrl. I'm used to this and know where everything is.
  - Backlit keys. This way you never have to worry about the paint rubbing off.
  - Wired or rechargeable. No batteries to replace please.
  - At least F1-F12, grouped in sets of 4.
  - Bonus keys like media keys should be above outside of the usual 104. A function may be on the right but definitely not on the left.
  - Water resistant. A "water proof" claim is questionable.
  - Quieter keys preferred but not required. Quieter avoids distractions during remote meetings, but lately microphones screen out the noise.
  - Large print preferred but not required.
  - To use a Windows keyboard on a Mac:
    - ALT works as OPTION ⌥
    - WIN ⊞ works as CMD ⌘
  - FYI: The closest I've found:
    - Azio KB505U or KB510W.
    - FINEDAY Keyboard 2.0. It's looks & feels lovely. Unfortunately it replaced the right win key with a fn key. PowerToys can't remap a fn key, but it can remap the menu key: which I almost never use and can be done with shift+f10.

### 1.3.3. Good

- The end of files (EOF) SHOULD have a blank line.
- Long versions of options for console commands SHOULD use a double dash, while the short versions use a single dash. E.g. `--force` and `-f`.
- The top of most of my HTML 5 documents SHOULD be: `<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><meta charset="utf-8">`
- [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) SHOULD be used. E.g.
  - `"foo": "1.8.7"`
    - `1`. MAJOR. Incompatible changes to the API.
    - `8`. MINOR. Backwards compatible additions to the API.
    - `7`. PATCH. Backwards compatible bug fixes.
- Font for code MUST be monospaced. Which font is a matter of choice; I like Google's [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) because it has great contrast between troublesome characters like `1Il0O1`, it **bolds** well, and it is free (libre & gratis).

## 1.4. SHOULD NOT

- Dibs. E.g. [Chicago's 'Dibs' Tradition Can Get Dirty, And Even Dangerous](https://www.npr.org/local/309/2020/03/02/811209907/chicago-s-dibs-tradition-can-get-dirty-and-even-dangerous).
- Graffiti on signs and homes
- Littering
- Jaywalking
- Low-waisted pants
- Not using turn signals
- Driving distracted, i.e. texting, doing social media, watching videos, etc.
- Firing guns into the air
- Loud music after midnight if your neighbors can hear it
- Anti: Vaccines, Round Earth, Evolution, Apollo Missions, Education & Science, Separation of church & state

## 1.5. Politics & Policies

Everyone looks out for themselves. Everyone protects & promotes their interests. Thus everyone should form their opinions. However we also have loved ones and we also live in a society, a [_polis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis). Politics & Policies affects many of us and thus we need to parse the many opinions.

I want to highlight key problems common to many political topics, then move on to particular issues, especially U.S. issues. TLDR: I'm a Progressive.

- HOW TO PARSE. If we cannot establish a framework to parse our opinions, we will not be building upon hard earned knowledge and be closing ourselves to better solutions. Our opinions should be parsed using best practices, evidence, well-formed logic, transparency, testing, perspective, etc., but also in an effective, timely, earnest, heard, woke, and emotionally conscious manner. This part of [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science).
- PROBLEMS > POLITICAL PROBLEMS. Please distinguish between the problems faced by the state vs. the political problems. Many become so focused on political problems that statesmanship is left behind. Deciding on the faction or the captain can overshadow keeping the ship afloat.
- RULE BY A FEW. You don't see modern instances of rule either by a [philosopher king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher_king) or several wise men (a [noocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy)), but there are many modern autocrats and [oligarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy). These issues are manifested in many ways.
  - Oligarchy is variation of [No taxation without representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation). Decent representation is a key element of democracies. Variants of non-representation include race, gender, minority (minoritarianism), age (gerontocracy), military (stratocracy), religion (theocracy), property ownership (timocracy), income (plutocracy), favoritism (nepotism), rule by the worst (kakistocracy), etc.
  - [Late capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_capitalism). Aka hypercapitalism. An [economic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system) is the flow of goods, services, and value. [Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) is a tool that helps with economic flow. [Capitalism] is an economic system on private ownership with an emphasis on money. Capitalism in moderation is good but hypercapitalism dams the economic flow, and concentrates it in a few.
  - Oligarchs have too much voice. Why are elections too expensive?
    - [Campaign finance reform in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_reform_in_the_United_States)
      - [Dark money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering)
      - [Citizens United v. FEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) (2010)
      - [Lobbying in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States)
      - [Political action committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee)
    - [Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering). Drawing the maps should NOT be done by the parties. The U.S. Census has been used as a tool for gerrymandering.
    - [Voter suppression in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States)
    - [Anti-competitive practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices)
    - [Telecommunications Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996). Media monopolies with poor journalistic standards are against the interests of the people.
    - [Conflict of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest). So much corruption, insider trading, side benefits, financial gifts, emoluments, etc.
  - Value > Money. Late stage capitalism also shifts the focus to money instead of value, this is like focusing on the finger pointing at the Moon instead of focusing on the Moon. Money is a proxy for value, not actual value. Profiteering eventually works against the People's interests. Artificial scarcity.
    - Too many advertisements.
    - Water: It is in the People's interests for everyone to have access to water. That is more important than making money by selling water.
      - [Nestlé Doesn't Think Water Is A Human Right - Bill Burr @ Conan (2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pb6r8VNWk)
      - [Is Water a Human Right? C-Suite Insights With Nestlé Chairman Peter Brabeck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GFjtiasm5w)
      - [The Evil Business of Nestlé](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoKLovtnbGY)
    - Some items are too expensive, i.e. not socialized, or have an artificial supply/demand scenario. Profiteering in these areas is entrenched in America.
      - The Military and police. Yes, the money per person in these areas should be high but their budgets are too large.
      - Healthcare and prescription drugs. U.S. healthcare is the most expensive but we don't have the best outcomes. Some interventions have questionable research and const-benefits ratios. Caveat emptor is difficult in healthcare.
      - Education, Scientific Journals
      - Funerals
      - Internet service
      - Incarceration. Racially biased. Profiteered.
      - Tax preparation services. It is more automated, simpler and cheaper in other countries. E.g. https://news.yahoo.com/irs-already-income-tax-data-130029063.html.
    - Some items are too cheap, i.e. subsidized. Profit is privatized but losses are socialized.
      - Farming, Fishing, Dairy
      - Fossil fuels & products
      - Mining
      - Damage to the environment, nature, animals, water, treasured sites, etc.
    - Social services
      - Some social services the U.S. already provides: primary & secondary education, public libraries, fire departments, police departments, the military, the Post Office, Medicare & Medicaid, some parks, emergency funding, transportation (via subsidizing highways & public transportation).
      - A society can be judged by how it takes care of its people. We have the resources to provide basic services with [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income) or modular basic income.
        - Food
        - Clean Air & Water
        - Shelter & Utilities
        - Healthcare
        - Childcare & Education
        - Maternity Leave & Elder Care
        - Technology access: Internet, computers, etc.
        - Transportation. More public transportation would also be greener.
      - Generational wealth should not be for oligarchies, dynasties, etc. There should be generational wealth for all of society. We can break the poverty cycle for everybody.
        - One way to transition to societal generational wealth is to increase profit sharing so that more workers of a company get a share of the profits.
        - There are many paths to justice: ["Martin Luther King Jr. and the Unfinished Work of Abolishing Poverty"](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/mlk-freedom-budget/).
      - Yes, people are different (gender, age, physical abilities, smarts, looks, etc) no one needs to be poor or uncared for.
- RULE BY THE MANY. A fair democracy is better than an oligarchy, but there are problems with misinformation, propaganda, and manipulation. Part of it is weak epistemology, but part of it can be contributed to purposeful campaigns. There is the adage "A lie is halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on", but the propagation of "false news" is magnified by social media.

### 1.5.1. Political Issues

Some issues can incite some people. The policy making process should be granular as much as possible and not bundled with trigger issues or pork issues. Here are some issues in alphabetical order.

- Abortion
  - Abortion is a difficult, horrific, and personal decision that I don't think anyone takes lightly, especially not the mother. Trust the mothers and their maternal instincts to make the hard decision.
  - Just because I am pro-choice does not mean I am pro-abortion. It means I understand that your choice is none of my damn business, and I will always fight for your right to choose.
  - Abortion should be avoided but there are cases where it should be done.
    Abortion should be an informed decision made by the mother and that it is her right and that government should stay out of it except to protect the right.
  - I think that most people are actually in agreement on the issue.
  - When does life begin? What is an embryo? Where is the line? [What Does the Bible Say About Abortion?](https://ffrf.org/component/k2/item/26087-abortion-nontract).
- Breast feeding
  - It's perfectly natural. It's free. It passes immunities from mother to child.
- Capital Punishment
  - There have been many cases of executing the wrong person. A clean solution is to not have executions.
- Drugs
  - I don't really smoke or drink let alone do drugs, but more drugs should be legalized because when it is illegal it happens anyway but in an unsafe and untaxed fashion. The war on drugs has done more harm than good.
  - Alcohol is legal but it probably does more harm tha cannabis.
- Environment, Climate Change, Climate Emergency.
  - We only have one planet. Odd that this is politicized.
  - There is a free atomic furnace in the sky. Odd that we don't do more solar.
- Federal Minimum Wage
  - While I believe that the free market should largely set wages, history has shown (with slavery, slum shops, child labor, etc) that the drive for profit naturally pushes the wage as low as possible. Thus, I believe the government and society should establish some sort of minimum wage.
  - As of 2022 the Federal Minimum Wage has not been adjusted for inflation in decades.
- Freedom of Speech
  - [Journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism). Yes, there is free speech, but journalistic organizations should be certified and held to a higher standard because of misinformation and conflicts of interest.
  - Unions are covered by free speech and freedom of peaceful assembly.
  - Yes, there is freedom of speech, but it is illegal to yell "Fire!" in crowds.
  - Some people use their freedom of speech to act entitled, make demands beyond the norm, insult others, etc.
- [Fatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism)
  - I'm not into determinism, but I believe the odds are not in our favor. Individuals vary but 50% are below average and everyone is susceptible to misinformation, ego, etc. Many problems have a part that is objective, evidence based, logical, etc., but the other part is subjective, political, popularity-based, etc.
  - [Denialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism).
  - [Handlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor): "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity".
  - [Bonhoeffer‘s Theory of Stupidity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww47bR86wSc). Stupid people are more dangerous than evil ones.
  - Fatalistic films
    - ["Stupidity"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupidity_(film)>) (2003).
    - ["Idiocracy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy) (2006).
    - ["The Road"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_(2009_film)>) (2009).
    - ["Don't Look Up"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Up) (2021).
- Genocide
  - People are people.
  - It's amazing that we even have to say that it's wrong, that denying it is wrong, that making excuses for it is wrong.
- Guns
  - I own guns myself. The gun media is riddled with fear and yet most people have never had a gun altercation or have had guns taken from them.
  - I think most people believe in the right to bear arms but that there should be certain safeties like requiring gun education and a background check when you buy guns. E.g. When I go to Bass Pro Shop to get a gun, I can't pick it up for 3 days. What's the big deal? On the other hand some laws are just inconvenient. E.g. I'm not sure if restricting silencers is useful.
- Identification
  - Until there is a global ID "card", every nation should have a national ID card.
- Identity, Race
  - People are people.
  - Everyone has an identity, a culture, a race; Heck, some people have multiples.
  - Be mindful of [xenophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia), [pejoratives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative), etc. See the lists of [ethnic slurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs) and [religious slurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_slurs).
  - Be mindful of [speciesism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism) and [biocentrism](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocentrism_(ethics)>). It makes sense to care for all our habitats. Even simple acts like opting for egg from free range chickens helps.
- Immigration
  - People are people.
  - Separating children from parents is wrong.
  - It doesn't seem to be about resources but racism and xenophobia. On one hand Americans want cheap labor, on the other hand there's resentment.
  - No one wants a statue, flag, etc. on public property that celebrates humiliating your people.
- Medically assisted suicide
  - We euthanize our pets.
  - If people OK their own euthanasia before they are in trouble, then I'm OK with it.
  - [Wabi-Sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi) applies to people. We are imperfect, incomplete, and impermanent. We get sick, injured, old, suffer, and die.
- Open
  - Any data, research, software, etc. paid with public money should belong to the public.
  - Open software should be used as much as possible.
  - Open politics because we should act courageously and enable prudent and tempered policies for society, in a just, fair, and transparent fashion.
- Police Brutality & Discrimination
  - Yes, there is [police brutality in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality_in_the_United_States). Step 1: Acknowledge it exists and is a problem. There are many countermeasures (body cameras, civilian review boards, etc.) but one that is often overlooked is that police offenders should be treated like sex and no-fly offenders: They should be listed in a registry and it should be difficult for them to repeat their offense.
- Protein
  - I'm not a vegetarian but I try to eat more plants.
  - Humans grow the fastest as babies, and breast milk is only 7% protein, so why do Americans eat diets with 3-4 times as much protein?
  - Animal-based protein uses far more resources than plant-based protein.
  - The amount of extra resources and animal suffering is astounding.
- Religion
  - [Freedom of religion in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_the_United_States) is constitutionally protected by the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).
  - The [separation of church and state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state) protects everyone. It also effectively defines that the U.S. is NOT a Christian nation even though there are many Christians in the U.S.
  - Since the People are of different religions, policy decisions should areligious and not tied to any religious texts.
  - I don't limit acquiring useful heuristics to one religion.
  - The U.S. relationship with Israel is odd and it probably has a religious basis.
  - [Freedom from Religion Foundation](https://ffrf.org/). Separating church from state protects you _from_ religion but also protects _your_ religion.
  - [The Satanic Temple](https://thesatanictemple.com/). Actually about skepticism and separating church from state than literal Satanism.
- Sex Offenders
  - Prevent and discourage human trafficking.
  - Sex offenders should be listed in a registry and it should be difficult for them to repeat their offense. E.g. It should be criminal for churches to move a sex offending priest to another church where they repeat their offense.
- Sexual orientation, gender identification, etc.
  - People are people.
  - Consent is the key rule for sexual activity. Be healthy, legal, educated, and kind too.
  - As far as LGBQT, etc. whatever float your boat. Marry who you want.
  - Reduce sexism, yes, but words like feminism and masculism can be widely interpreted. Instead focus on treating people like humans regardless of gender or sexual orientation.
  - The state should do sex education in high school because people have sex anyway and it's a public health issue.
  - Legalize prostitution because when it is illegal it happens anyway but in an unsafe and untaxed fashion.
  - As far as your health record goes, gender at birth is the closest thing we have to a standard.
- Sovereignty
  - Amazing that this is an issue at all. Usually its because people are violating the rules of "Don't be a dick" and "People are people". Separate and be done with it.
  - Palestine, Ireland, Ukraine, Hong Kong, Tibet, Taiwan, etc.
- Vaccines
  - Most anti-vaccination stances are unfounded and conspiratorial.
