# My opinions

Ah, you've made it here. Again I'm sharing some of my opinions to express myself and maka a minor contribution to society.

- I'm not here to write long elaborate manifestos about everything, but rather to make short expressive statements on select subjects.
- I'm not here to totally change the world. I'm just muttering to myself on GitHub, not making massive statements on every social media platform.

- Time and Date Standard: [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601): YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. http://xkcd.com/1179/. I wonder if 2019\10\03-24 would have been better?
