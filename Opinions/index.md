# My opinions

On this page I'm sharing some of my opinions to express myself and maka a minor contribution to society.

- I'm not here to write long elaborate manifestos about everything, but rather to make short expressive statements on select subjects.
- I'm not here to totally change the world. I'm not doing a sophisticated coordinated campaign utilizing every social media platform. Rather I'm just muttering to myself on GitHub.

### SHOULD

### SHOULD Best

- Time and Date Standard: [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601): YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. http://xkcd.com/1179/. I wonder if 2019\10\03-24 would have been better?
- System of Measurement: Metric. However I have a few personal opinions.
    - The prefixes for the positive exponents SHOULD change from:
        - `[da, h, k, M, G,  T,  P,  E,  Z,  Y] to:`
        - `[ D, H, K, M, G,  T,  P,  E,  Z,  Y]. e:`
        - `[ 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24]`
    - The prefixes for the negative exponents are fine:
        - `[d, c, m, μ, n,  p,  f,  a,  z,  y]. e-:`
        - `[1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24]`
        - ISO 2955 was on track: µ isn't ASCII but it's easy to enter with a keyboard input like EN INTL.

### SHOULD Better

- Breastfeeding > Formula
- Toilet rolls releasing from the top > bottom
- A4 paper (ISO 216) > 8.5"x11"
- Common Era (CE) > AD
- Butter > Margarine
- Languages with few characters > 100s of characters
- LibreOffice > Open Office. LO can incorporate features from OO, but not the other way. LO has ~50x as many users.
- Renewable & Reusable > Single use
- Period (.) > Comma (,). For use as a decimal character, the period is simpler.
- Wheelbarrow with centrally-mounted wheel > end-mounted wheel
