Here is some stuff that I find wonderful, almost magical.

- Water: Clouds. Waves. Bodies of water. Floating.
- Wind: Breezes. Windmills.
- Flight
- Plants & Trees. Photosynthesis & Photons.
- Pre-Verbals
- Salt
- Math, Triangles, Circles. E.g. 3² + 4² = 5²
- Craftsmanship & Care. By any species, in any capacity.
- [_Bagheera kiplingi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagheera_kiplingi). Of the 40K species of spiders, this is the only one that is mostly herbivorous.
