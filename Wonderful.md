Here is some stuff that I find wonderful, almost magical.

- Children
- Water: Clouds. Waves. Bodies of water. Floating.
- Breezes
- Flight
- Plants & Trees. Photosynthesis & Photons.
- Pre-Verbals
- Salt
- Math, Triangles Circles. E.g. 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^^2
- Craftsmanship & Care. By any species, in any capacity.
- Bagheera kiplingi. Of the 40K species of spider this is the only one that is vegetarian.
