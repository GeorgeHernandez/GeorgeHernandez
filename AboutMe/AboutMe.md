> [!tldr]
> I was born 1968 in the Philippines. I moved to America when I was 4. I am deaf in my left ear. I've lived almost entirely in Chicago since then. I've done martial arts since I was 7. I graduated from Lane Tech HS. I got a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering at UIC. I am happily married with 3 wonderful kids. After working in various capacities, I worked for over 20  years in healthcare and public health doing software and database development for hospitals and the federal government. I volunteer at the [Rizal Center](https://rizalcenter.org) by doing their website and teaching martial arts. I should finish my Masters in Education for Science Education in 2025-05 at UIC so I can serve as a high school teacher wherever the [Chicago Public Schools](https://www.cps.edu/) need me.
