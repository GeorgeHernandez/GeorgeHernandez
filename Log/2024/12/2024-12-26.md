summary:: Log notes for 2024-12-26.

I'm playing with using more Obsidian (and its Dataview community plugin) in this workspace. If it is satisfactory, then I may do more of my notes with Obsidian.

Most of my notes are currently in Google Drive as Google Docs. It would be too much work to port over my notes, but I can start building up public notes.

I don't really care to be an influencer or managing another site/email. I'm more concerned about lining up my ducks.
