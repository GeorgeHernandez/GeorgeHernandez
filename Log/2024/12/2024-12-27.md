summary: Obsidian is coming along nicely.

I installed Dataview for making linked directory listings, but any tables or lists it produce don't affect the graph view. It should become more useful when I have many files. So fare I've only added a few CSE related files.

I made a private Obsidian vault repo for my family. I think it will work, especially with the graph view. So far I've only entered my wife, kids, and the grandparent using this as the body of the template:

```text
