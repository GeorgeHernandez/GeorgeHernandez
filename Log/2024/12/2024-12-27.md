I installed Dataview for making linked directory listings, but any tables or lists it produces doesn't affect the graph view. That's is as it should be for querying. It should become more useful when I have many files. So fare I've only added a few CSE related files.

I made a private Obsidian vault repo for my family. I think it will work, especially with the graph view. So far I've only entered my wife, kids, and the grandparent using a template with these fields:
```text
summary

type
title
first-name
nick-name
middle-name
last-name
maiden-last-name
gender-at-birth
gender
date-of-birth
city-of-birth
state-of-birth
country-of-birth
date-of-death
city-of-death
state-of-death
country-of-death
parents
spouse
date-of-marriage
children
```

The type field defaults to `Person`.
