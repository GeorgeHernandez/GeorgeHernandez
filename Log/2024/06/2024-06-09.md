## Kalasag Plans

The precolonial Filipinos used 2 kinds of shields:
- A [Kalasag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalasag) is a tall shield (taller than it is wide), held by the hand.
- A [Taming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taming_(shield)) is a circular shield held on the forearm.

Circular shields are easy to come by, but Kalasag are not.

One of my projects this summer is to make a few Kalasag shields. This post is just the general ideal. I plan to build some Kalasag in August, i.e. after I’m done with summer classes for my Master’s in Education in Science Education at UIC.

I have looked at historical designs but in the adaptive spirit of Filipino Martial Arts, I am making some adaptations. I’d like to use materials readily available to a Filipino American in Chicago.

I’d like to make at least 3 Kalasag:
- 30 cm x 120 cm (1′ x 4′). Tall enough to use as a tower-style, i.e. rested on the ground.
- 30 cm x 90 cm (1′ x 3′).
- 30 cm x 60 cm (1′ x 2′). Small enough to use buckler-style, i.e. held forward in the hand.
- 
Each is the same width so that the width will not be a variable. The following figure shows some other designs I considered. Top-heavy tilts well. Central handles facilitate linear movements without rotation. I’ve decided to go with the 4th design, the one with multiple “spear rests” or “blade traps”: 1 on top, and 2 on each side. I don’t consider the rest on the bottom to be a rest or a trap. The corner could be used offensively, but since these are intended for free play and will be less pointy.

The handle will be a gate pull that is concave for nestling a spear. These are readily available at many hardware stores or online. I hope the following figure sufficiently shows the curve I’m talking about. For stability I plan to replace the wood screws with nuts and bolts.

Another feature that I want to play with are anti-twist blocks above and below the handle. Without the blocks, if you hold a spear with the handle and a blow hits the spear above the shield, then it is held in place only by the strength of your grip. With the blocks your opponent would have to also overcome the mass of the shield.

I want to go with 10-12 mm (3/8″ to 1/2″). Perhaps Poplar since its specific gravity of 0.4, which is not too far from the 0.3 specific gravity of Rattan.

The edging is my most doubtful area. A resin treatment is historically correct. I will start with a resin treatment and see if it is sufficient for use in free play with stick, spears, steel, and such.

The front can be decorated any which way!
