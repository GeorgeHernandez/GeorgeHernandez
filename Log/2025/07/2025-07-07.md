11:08 #courage/my-exercise #courage/my-martial-arts I'm going to start making public notes on what I've long called HExMAS (health, exercise, martial arts, and survival). I will try to not just dump stuff but instead provide some structure:
- Developmental Progression Levels: The division is not so much about age or capability, but exposure to previous content and practice of it, depth and breadth. Three levels:
    - Novice Level. This content assumes no prior knowledge or practice of HExMAS. Most people never get beyond the Novice Level, so the content should be essentials of high priority.
    - Intermediate Level. This content builds upon Novice Level Content.
    - Advanced Level. This content builds upon Intermediate Level Content.
- Topics: The following general topics:
    - Safety
    - Teaching & Learning
    - Modes
    - History & Culture
    - Gear
    - Reference Positions
    - Locomotion
    - Actions
    - Partner Activity
- Bites: Knowledge is shared and explored one bite at a time. A bite is a conversation, demo, drill, idea, video, etc. The large and complex are built upon the small and simple. I will try to keep each piece small and simple. A lesson might have a few bites, but if there are too many bites, then the lesson is indigestible.
