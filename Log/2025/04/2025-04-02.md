05:23 #cognition/my-education As a teacher, I have printed many assignments and I've been using 0.25" margin all around to maximize print area and minimize the use of paper. However, I'm thinking of playing with storing student work in binders. If I do double-sized printing then I'll want my margins to be 0.25" top & bottom, but 0.75" left & right. FYI: To keep things tight I also use single-spacing (instead of a more comfortable 1.15 spacing) and a 10pt font. My default font is Consolas (a sans-serif mono-spaced font which helps with lining up content).

05:32 Last month was very busy. It would be tidy if I logged everyday, but it isn't necessary. I already log food, health, etc. in a non-public spreadsheet. It is onerous to double entries in public log.
