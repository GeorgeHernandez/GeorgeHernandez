05:53 #culture I woke up this morning thinking about the primacy of love and all the gifts it brings: compassion, kindness, patience, comfort, courage, nourishment, value, and so on. Some creatures are born and are expected to immediately make their way in the world by themselves. In contrast, human babies are born entirely dependent on parental care. With our first breath (*spiritus* in Latin), we cry  out in need of love, comfort, and nourishment. As we grow up we need to learn to love and care for ourselves and others. Especially in cases of conflict we should start with a salute, a greeting of love, and acknowledgement that the other is trying to meet their needs. Conflict should be dealt with temperance, prudence, justice, and courage, but conflict without love diminishes both sides and often leads to "justified" objectification, cruelty, and hate. Martin Luther King Jr. said, "Let no man pull you so low as to hate him".
