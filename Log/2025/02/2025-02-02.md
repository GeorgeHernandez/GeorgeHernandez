05:53 #culture I woke up this morning thinking about the primacy of love and all the gifts it brings: compassion, kindness, patience, comfort, courage, nourishment, value, and so on. Some creatures are born and are expected to immediately make their way in the world by themselves. In contrast, human babies are born entirely dependent on parental care. With our first breath (*spiritus* in Latin), we cry  out in need of love, comfort, and nourishment. As we grow up we need to learn to love and care for ourselves and others. Especially in cases of conflict we should start with a salute, a greeting of love, and acknowledgement that the other is trying to meet their needs. Conflict should be dealt with temperance, prudence, justice, and courage, but conflict without love diminishes both sides and often leads to "justified" objectification, cruelty, and hate. Martin Luther King Jr. said, "Let no man pull you so low as to hate him". 

09:47 #cognition/my-education Yesterday I attended a CPS Pre-Service Teaching Equity Program (P-STEP) Summit. One of the activities we did was to list our priorities then compare them to a typical weekly schedule. This gives you perspective on whether your priorities match the amount of time you spend on each. I try to combine priorities like reading while commuting or doing chores while studying. In terms of my "cognition, courage, culture" (mind, body, spirit) model, it should be noted that  somethings one does solo (like sleep), but somethings one does benefits others as well. This connects to the concept that there is greater utility in having society use capital to benefit all of us, instead of having a few individuals aggregating absurd amounts of capital for themselves and their dynasty.
