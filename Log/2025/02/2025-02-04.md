#courage/my-exercise I haven't been logging these at GitHub, but I often do [24 Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-form_tai_chi) (a Tai Chi form) when I'm waiting for a train or bus when there aren't a lot of folks around.

I was just thinking that sometimes I momentarily focus on how others are unreliable, annoying, disappointing, etc. Instead I should remember love at those moments. If a toddler vexes you, you shouldn't despise them, but should instead breath, be patient, and remember love, imperfection, impermanent, incomplete.
