## Adorno

Notes regarding *Philosophical Elements of a Theory of Society* by Theodor W. Adorno (1964). Edited by Tobias ten Brink and Marc Phillip Nogueira. Translated by Wieland Hoban. (2019). The 2nd half of the book: Lectures 10-17, pp. 79-139.

- p. 79 "One could say that reality is itself both logical and alogical."
    - Tautology much?    
- p. 80 "Adam Smith’s *Wealth of Nations*, in addition to the laws of exchange that he defines objectively, the author already introduced the principle of fair play, which subsequently entered everyday language, even the German language. So this means that the entire construction applies only if certain irreducible irrational moral laws are followed, laws whose essence is that one should follow the rules of the game."  
- "One could say that, here in particular, one finds one of the central reasons why such strictly rational models are no longer adequate for understanding society, namely that society is increasingly disregarding its own defined rational rules. When Hitler, for example, to give you a very drastic illustration – we analysed these things a little in Dialectic of Enlightenment – makes a contract, then declares that he hopes Mr Chamberlain, or whoever it might be, will be reasonable and see sense, then reason here no longer means upholding a rational contract based on rational laws; rather, if one analyses it, it means he should recognize that he, **Mr Hitler, has more numerous and more powerful cannons, at least at the time of presenting such demands, and that Chamberlain should therefore yield to his power**. So, in this phase, the same reason that once insisted precisely on following the rules is emancipated from keeping to the rules and now becomes what it was not in its better days: a recognition of the respectively prevailing, blind power. If I can just skim a little cream off the top of that for a philosophical theory of society, I would say it shows that, even a category such as reason, which was taken as an invariant formal-logical rule, for example by Kant, as a permanently self-identical and eternal category, changes with the structures of society. So this means that, **if one is the weaker party facing an outwardly incredibly powerful and aggressive dictatorship, the reasonable thing to do is precisely the opposite of the concept of reason, the contradiction of reason as classically understood, though with the addition of the specifically fascist dynamic, where reason itself now turns into manifest unreason**."
    - Hitler, Trump, the Joker.  
- p. 81 "So this brings us to the same matter I explained to you in the last few sessions, insisting that **one of the central tasks of a theory of society, and of sociology in general, is to understand even those aspects that seemingly contradict a unified theory formation**. And a theory that is capable of grasping precisely those things that elude the traditional concept of deductive theory is the exact elaboration of this paradox, if you will. That is really what can be expected of a dialectical theory – which is anathema to the conventional attitudes with which we are all infused – and this is the real effort which I would say that both philosophy and sociology demand of you. In this respect, I would think, there is in fact no difference between the two disciplines – I will not go into the reasons for that now. **At any rate, the task with which you, with which we, are confronted is quite simply to liberate ourselves from the notion that, simply put, the best and truest and most adequate theory is that which is most coherent and contradiction-free in an immediate sense, without consideration for what the reality actually is and what reality imposes on us**."    
- p. 82 "**Naïve thinking** – and this naïveté, ladies and gentlemen, by no means refers merely to pre-scientific thinking but, rather, is a naïveté that I would argue is possibly hardened and consolidated in us by the traditional concept of science and its classificatory structures – insists on a kind of choice. **Here we are expected to choose all or nothing, to think in binary terms**. So the demand is to select either theory in the sense of a contradiction-free, possibly deductive or at least unanimously organized system or, if one stumbles on the fact that this system is not without problems, that something is lacking, one immediately throws the entire system overboard and says, ‘So, our faith in systems’ – people especially like to speak of faith – ‘has been shaken, which means that we must do without any system.’"    
- "it seems to me that, of all the thinking habits with which people generally approach theory, one of the most dangerous is to do so with demands that stem from their own needs rather than being immanent to theory itself, in particular such needs where one simply cannot say a priori whether a theory will fulfil them."    
- p. 83 "for countless people working in the field of social science, it is more important to have something like a unified theory covering as many things as possible, with enough space to accommodate whatever facts one finds, than to have, instead of such a sociological theory designed to act as the measure of what is true or false, a theory of society that is not so unified in itself, namely one that reflects the nature of society. **This glorification of unified knowledge at the cost of truth, which is not unified, essentially amounts to what I wish to describe as the fetishization of science**."    
- p. 84 "So its point was that one should not presume anything that is not seen *clare et distincte* by the individual, the individually thinking, judging mind; and, at the beginning of the modern age, the leaders of the two feuding schools of philosophy, namely **Bacon and Descartes**, were entirely in agreement on that point. Both of them directed the concept of science in the same way against merely traditional, dogmatically adopted knowledge. Then, in a process shaped primarily by the increasingly consistent development of the great rationalist systems, **the concept of science as the production of the world from pure thought established itself in more and more radical ways, finally becoming the concept of ‘absolute knowledge’ as an absolute consciousness and absolute reality that produces itself from itself**."    
- p. 85 "Consequently the Leibnizian concept of a *mathesis universalis*, a rational universal science, is connected to the doctrine of pre-established harmony and the productive imagination of the monad in a way that is far from merely superficial; rather, these two major tendencies in Leibniz’s philosophy are directly linked in their innermost motivations. So this now grows into the doctrine of the absolute character of science as the attempt to elaborate the totality of everything that exists from the philosophical concept itself, as first shown formally and expounded methodologically with the greatest precision by Fichte, before Hegel attempted, with a force that was never achieved again, to apply it in every detail. **If you read Fichte or Hegel, if you read phrases such as ‘doctrine of science’ or ‘science of phenomenal consciousness’ in Hegel**, you can only understand the concept of science if you perceive its twofold character, namely that, on the one hand, it follows on from the incredible progress of rational science made in the modern age, but, on the other hand, it is almost taken for granted from the outset, **presenting the claim that this science itself is actually the phenomenal absolute** – a claim, moreover, that, in a certain sense, was already present in the far more cautious and less – how shall I put it? – less self-indulgent Kant, **for Kant doubts and critically analyses all manner of things, but never questions the validity of science itself**."    
- p. 86 "One might also say what the fetishism of science means is that the division of labour which led to the separation of a specialist branch, namely science with its fixed methods, has been turned into an absolute, or at least glorified, such that this newly grown branch, science, from which anyone remotely organizationally involved in it derives not only their material existence but also their social status and their prestige, that this branch is the index sui or the *index veri et falsi*, without genuinely reflecting on its own preconditions"    
- "One could also say that the method posits itself in place of the truth while, in reality, it is really nothing but the means for the recognition of the truth"
    - I agree. Science is a tool to acquire knowledge. The knowledge it acquires (aka The Science) is merely a model of reality.
- "**I ask you not to misunderstand me**, and especially not to take my criticism, my very fundamental and also mediated criticism of science, as anything like a rejection of science in favour of intuitionism or some other such thing. I would like to think that the continuity of what I am saying protects me somewhat from such misunderstandings by the well disposed among you, but, on the other hand, the fact that one cannot say everything in a single statement means that one repeatedly finds oneself in danger of such misunderstandings. So, let me make this highly necessary correction: naturally it is not as if the methods of science have nothing to do with the object, for the sharpening of scientific tools, the refinement of the criteria one uses in order to assess the validity of scientific theorems, of course means that something of the matter asserts itself."    
- Lecture 13    
- p. 134 "First of all, let me say that, in keeping with the current negative state and t**he acceptance of this antagonistic state by the overwhelming majority of people in all countries, the oft-cited de-ideologization of the world is a fiction**. And, to put it bluntly, it is precisely this de-ideologization itself that is one of the specific manifestations of ideology today – or, in other words, the reality in which we live, this antagonistic reality that is forced upon us, shows a tendency to become an ideology of its own. **The example of this is consumerism**, where people in all conceivable sectors of society consume and possibly enjoy what is forced on them out of no motive except profit, without any actual or even any potential subjective need for it; and then they even view this imposition as enjoyment and feel marvellously realistic when they buy televisions and all the other rubbish that goes with them, giving up their ideals without realizing that they are being fooled incomparably more by the trash that the entire consumer world has become than they were ever fooled in better times by ideologies, which were at least meant to have some ambition for truth, something that is now being abandoned. **People see fulfilment, reality itself, in things that are mere substitutes**, substitutes imposed on them by profit interests. And their so-called realism is an ideology, in the sense that their behaviour reproduces this behaviour which is forced on them – indeed, it must be said that they even continue it of their own accord. They participate in what is forced on them, they submit unconsciously to the ruling apparatus, and they consider themselves realistic because the context of delusion connecting them with what exists has become so complete that there is no longer any daylight between the false reality and their false consciousness. I think that only if one recognizes with such uncompromising severity what the true nature of so-called realism and so-called de-ideologization today actually is, only then can one face the current situation without illusions."
- p. 136 "What I mean by the technological veil is that constraints and necessities resulting from social conditions – for example, all the phenomena connected to the standardization not only of consumer goods but also of contents of consciousness – are ascribed to technology as such, completely ignoring things like the fact that, under the prevailing motive of profit, technology has been developed only in a very one-sided, particular fashion, namely to keep its production costs low, and that anything connected to decentralization, individualization or qualitative diversity has been suppressed and, if I might use the word, prevented artificially by this constraint of the profit motive."

I then posted this in Blackboard about the reading:
- Adorno  (p. 134) spoke of consumerism: "people in all conceivable sectors of society consume and possibly enjoy what is forced on them out of no motive except profit, without any actual or even any potential subjective need for it; and then they even view this imposition as enjoyment and feel marvellously realistic". This was rampant in the 1950s and continues on today in different ways. There are ads in everything, Amazon at our fingertips, and social media occupying  our time and framing our worldviews.
- (I am trusting that others will speak of Adorno (p. 80) using Hitler to illustrate how strictly rational models are no longer adequate for society, because it is very applicable to the current administration. "if one is the weaker party facing an outwardly incredibly powerful and aggressive dictatorship, the reasonable thing to do is precisely the opposite of the concept of reason, the contradiction of reason as classically understood, though with the addition of the specifically fascist dynamic, where reason itself now turns into manifest unreason.".)
