#cognition/my-education Last week some of my students mentioned that they would not attend on Monday (today) as part of a protest. I think it is called ["A Day Without Immigrants"](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/businesses-across-the-chicago-area-close-for-a-day-without-immigrants-protest/3663649/). At Hubbard High School where I teach it manifested as 60-80% of students absent in the classes I taught. So proud to have students resisting!
