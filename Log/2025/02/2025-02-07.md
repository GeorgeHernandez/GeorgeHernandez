This is related to the concept of [SNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) metaphor I use a lot: I just want some simple music, but instead my neurodivergent filter provides constant dissonance. I a symphony or super-signal would be nice, I would benefit greatly if I could reduce the noise from my own brain. I *feel* I can sort of filter out the noise from others.
