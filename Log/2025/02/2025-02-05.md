This is a rather random comment I was reflecting on how I compressed my shower protocols.

My previous shower protocols:
- Wet & scrub all.
- Upper body:
    - Soap.
    - Scrub. 
    - Rinse & scrub.
- Middle body:
    - Soap.
    - Scrub. 
    - Rinse & scrub.
- Lower body:
    - Soap.
    - Scrub. 
    - Rinse & scrub.
- Heavily pepper the entire process with daydreaming. I would often forget what steps I was at.

My current shower protocols:
- For the entire body but starting from the bottom:
    - Wet & scrub.
    - Soap.
    - Scrub. 
    - Rinse & scrub.
- Daydream later.
