#cognition/my-education "Philosophical Elements of a Theory of Society" (Theodor W. Adorno 1964), pp. 1-78, i.e. Lectures 1-9. 

The reflection I had posted prior to class:
- Adorno seems quite critical of positivism: "I keep having occasion or feel the need to criticize the prevailing positivist mindset in the social sciences" (p. 72), " I believe positivism itself to be a manifestation of ideology today, and an especially dangerous one, because the positivist mindset declares itself the most anti-ideological, sober, objective one of all, but, by rejecting everything that is not a fact, through this exclusivity of the factual, it bestows an aura upon factuality that is generally drawn from the very same metaphysics which the current positivists consider such a taboo. " (p. 73).
- While I agree that insisting upon empiricism as the only source of knowledge is not just limiting (by rejecting intuition, instinct, etc.) but can also be abused as the only scripture in town, I  think the probability and danger of people abusing outright deceit is much greater than people abusing facts.

I got to class a bit late so I took notes using my phone. Here's a dump of the notes I took during our discussion of 
- p. 8 authorities: charismatic, traditional, rational. 
- p. 9 he prophesied with incredible precision, based purely on the concept of rationally bureaucratic rule, ... Blind rule
- p. 10 In the previous session....
- p. 12 the fact that even so called positivist research ....
- ch 9 p. 70 (83 PDF)
- Positivism
- Too big to fail, socialism for the bourgeois 
- Fetishizing the material. In a world where everything is for sale, everything is abstract, people are drawn to concretism, positivism vs abstractionism. 
- Prepackaged tours are artificial. 
- P 49 abstractionism positivism. The latter shuts down authentic discourse. abstractionism detached from empiricism. Knowledge becomes an object of exchange. 
- The Musk takeover feels unstoppable. You need theory, a framework to solve things because just accumulating facts isn't enough. 
- The grasping of the.   Non identical 
- Integration 
- People voting acting etc in a way that supports the oligarchy because they believe that they will one day rise to that rank. 
- The rich not flaunting their wealth concealed class antagonism. In modern times flaunting it does the same by implying that everyone can be wealthy. 
- Liberalism denies power differentials, i.e. conceals class struggles. 
- He favors the negative because struggle & antagonism improves instead of denies the struggle, that we are not self same. Hmmm apparently I favor produtive antagonism, acknowledging struggle. 
- Disenchantment of the world. Myth disappears. Rationality turns irrational. E.g. Nukes, capitalism, climate change, AI, our daily lives rat race. People as instruments, as machines ourselves. We should be subjects, not objects. 
- The current administration is dismantling all equity spending, attacking the poor, favoring privatization 
- Bourgeosification: Viewing other bourgeosie competition. 
- The denial of the uniqueness of self denies the self. 
- "Scorched Earth" Jonathan Crary. 
- Is Adorno just critical without advocating a prescription?
- Adorno is criticizing both abstractionism and concretism. People need intellectual tools to effect change, to enable social antagonism, critical pedagogy. 

I finished the class using some discussions my wife and I have during marriage counseling as an analogue for Adorno's view on Positivism:
- I'm a problem solver but my wife often perceives it as me dominating the conversation.
- Positivism is can be used in an autocratic fashion to dominate conversation and squash discourse.
- Domination is not my intent but problem solving is how I commonly operate. However the proverb "the road to hell is paved with good intentions" means at least 2 things: 1. Intentions without action is insufficient. 2. The effect and consequences of one's actions are more important than one's intent. The latter applies in my case where I have no ill intent but the effect on my wife is that she feels unheard, dominated, and gaslighted. Of course part of the issue is her inner filter, but I should be mindful of my part.
- The instructor concluded with a humorous comment along the lines that one should not use Adorno for therapy. Adorno's lectures are more about sociology than personal relationships.
