#cognition/my-education 

I worked through the night to make sure I have slides and an assignment ready for Friday.

I've been discussing the issue of very late assignments with various teachers.
- An assignment typically has a due date (say 03-01). 
- Students may be absent or there may be issues with differentiation, so a teacher might set a late date (say 03-07).
- Even after the late date, there will be a trickle of submissions. However at some point the teacher has graded most of the assignments and will do a return date (say 03-14).
- After the return date, copying increases, but a teacher may generously still accept submissions with out a penalty. This generosity has limits and it is commonly at 30 days beyond the due date (say 04-01).

What to do then is the issue.

Assignments turned in 30 days beyond its due date will...
- ... not be accepted. Converts to missing, 0%, F.
- ... be graded at 60%, i.e. the minimum passing grade (~D).
- ... be graded 10% lower (drop 1 letter grade), with a minimum of 60%.
- ... be graded 20% lower (drop 2 letter grades), with no minimum.
