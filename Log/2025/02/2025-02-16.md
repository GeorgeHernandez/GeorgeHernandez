09:00 #gear My new Lenovo Legion 5i is wonderful. The keyboard layout is more like a standard keyboard. I was able to play StarCraft II if full mode with out any issues. I actually prefer to not have a fingerprint reader.

17:16 #courage/my-martial-arts Taught MARC: Rapier intro. How to hold it, advantages of on top, front edge, leverage, cones of offense & defense, keeping line long, gaining sword while moving in (similar to doing sinawali while moving in). Free play: rapier v rapier, rapier v 1 baston, rapier v 2 bastons.
