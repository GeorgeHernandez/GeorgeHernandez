08:59 ["Everything Trump did in the first executive orders and actions of his presidency"](https://apnews.com/article/what-has-trump-done-trump-executive-orders-f061fbe7f08c08d81509a6af20ef8fc0) (AP News 2025-01-22) is a recap that doesn't include the past few weeks (especially DOGE overstepping). The headings include:
- Immigration and U.S. borders
- International trade, business and the economy
- Climate, energy and the environment
- Diversity, transgender rights and civil rights
- Federal workers and government structure
- Health care
- Foreign policy, national security and ‘America First’
- Nationalism
- Death penalty and crime
- The Capitol riot and 2020 campaign redux

I don't have the resources (time, energy, etc.) to write about how unwise, unjust, unmoderated, and cowardly much of this is. It seems that a significant portion of the American public is herded and framed into particular worldviews that are against the public interests (and their own interests). 

I'm posting this message in Bluesky:

> [!attention]
> **WE ARE ON THE SAME TEAM**
>
> We have more in common (problems & principles) than differences.
>
> 1. **WAKE UP**. Stop wasting time. Let's get our hearts in the right place.
> 2. **COLLABORATE**. We need ALL our hearts, heads, & hands to solve our problems.
