19:28 #courage/my-martial-arts I just got back from spending over 6 hours at [Forteza Fitness](https://www.fortezafitness.com/) for a [Historical African Martial Arts Seminar with Da'mon Stith](https://fortezafma.sites.zenplanner.com/event.cfm?eventId=1B5F88C4-7FC7-40CA-BA6A-CA082225CD24).

In case the link ever breaks, here's the description of the 2 workshops:

> [!info]
> **1:00pm-3:30pm : ‘Throw Hands’ Weaponized Boxing in Africa and Diaspora**
> 
> Indigenous pugilism in Africa is deeply rooted in weapon-based arts, often inspired by the use of a shield alongside edged or impact weapons such as swords, sticks, clubs, axes, knives, or spears. This concept reflects the martial realities of ancient societies, where shields were integral to combat, and striking techniques mirrored the movements of weapon use. In this workshop, we will explore indigenous boxing arts that embody these principles, focusing on styles like Dambe from Nigeria, Zuar wrist-knife fighting from Sudan, and Kandeka slap-boxing from Angola, each offering unique insights into the connection between unarmed and armed combat traditions.
> 
> **3:30pm-6:00pm : Ikiri Ada: The Restless Machete**
> Ikiri Ada, meaning "the Restless Machete" in Yoruba, is my personal machete fencing style—a unique fusion of diverse traditions from across the African Diaspora, designed for personal defense and self-expression. In this class, we will explore the foundational principles, movements, and techniques of several machete fencing styles, including:
> - Esgrima y Machete (Colombia)
> - Tire Machet (Haiti)
> - Garrote (Venezuela)
> - Kokobale (Puerto Rico)
> 
> Participants will gain insight into the core elements of each tradition and discover how they complement and connect, forming a cohesive and dynamic approach to machete fencing.

It was a great seminar: Lots of good material, practice, exercise, and music. I asked a fair number of questions, such as the preference for hand shields. I told him about making shields from old skateboards. I will try to regurgitate what I can before dinner.

I liked the Dambe pugilism from Nigeria, which uses the same model as their shield & spear work. A hand-held shield held forward becomes a defensive hand. The 3 basic attacks with the spear (and their pugilism equivalent) are:
1. An earth-side, hammer-grip thrust from above becomes an Angle #1 hammer fist.
2. A heaven-side, flashlight-grip thrust from the shoulder become a straight punch.
3. A heaven-side, hammer-grip thrust from below become a rising punch.

I liked the Kandeka slap-boxing from Angola, which uses the same model as their double-stick work. Basically each hand holds a stick (perhaps 1 m long) by its middle held high (similar to the spear attack #1 in Dambe). In the slap-boxing, the hands are held in those positions and kicks are allowed. It had a Muay Thai vibe.

I don't remember much of the Zuar wrist-knife fighting from Sudan, but I recall throwing by pressing the body close, placing either leg behind, and using the same side to throw them back. Here are some links about the wrist-knife (it is larger than I imagined):

21:37 OK I'm back from dinner and I need to get to bed soon so I'll wrap this up fast. 

There was a lot of animal walking when we switched partners. We got a lot of [Capoeira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira) work even though it wasn't listed. I liked the turning/spinning kick variants such as 0..2 hands on the ground. Eventually we did Capoeira free play. All the [ginga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginga_(capoeira)), swaying and going low was reminiscent of Visayan-style elastico or [Silat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silat).

The Tire Machet from Haiti was an interesting system that only had 2 blocks: A heaven-side, hammer-grip vertical blocks for all swings and thrusts except for the vertical downward blow (Angle #7) which was handled by a horizontal St. George block or cut into their wrist in a very low stance.

There was a bunch of other stuff, but I think my favorite was the build up to a drill of the same heaven-side, hammer-grip vertical block to a blow followed by a thrust. This built sensitivity of how to block without a handguard.

There was a build up of partner work that was basically dealt with attack with ither outside passes or jams. The was done with knives then sticks.

Near the very end all the attendees did free play with Da'mon Stith. That was a lot of fun. The machetes of the Americas seem to be smaller, lighter, and more mass produced than the machetes found in Filipino open markets.

Overall it was a great seminar and I would love to see more!
