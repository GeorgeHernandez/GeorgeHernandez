05:20 #courage/my-exercise 20 each (pushups, situps, squats). 10 each (pike pushups, hands feet supine bridges, pistols). 

09:59 #note-taking I've just cancelled my enyoenso.com site, the domain registration, hosting, databases, etc. I made it a year ago to restart a personal website, but I just don't have the time & interest  to do so. My GitHub profile and Obsidian works just fine for my needs. I captured the tiny bit of content there. In contrast, my old site georgehernandez.com had years of content.
