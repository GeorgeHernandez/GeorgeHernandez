07:01 I have more things that need to be recharged than I thought. I'm noticing it today because I'm doing my quarterly recharging. Just for kicks, here are my rechargeable things:

1. Basement: TV remote. 
2. Bug out bag: USB light. 
3. Desk: Kindle. A legacy item. I usually use my phone or laptop instead.
4. Desk: Monitor dial. 
5. Desk: Monitor remote. 
6. Doorbell. I recharge weekly. One of these days I'll switch to a wired one.
7. Earbuds. I recharge daily.
8. Laptop. I recharge daily. 
9. Miscellaneous solar calculators. Thankfully I don't have to plug these in.
10. Phone. I recharge daily. 
11. Toiletry bag: USB light. 
12. Work bag: Solar bank. 
13. Work bag: USB light. 
14. Work bag: Carabiner USB light.
