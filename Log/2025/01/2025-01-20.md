11:27 #culture It's [Martin Luther King Jr. Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day) here in America. My family went out and handed out cards to help people know your rights  when encountering ICE (https://www.icirr.org/resources). Of course MLKJ Day is about many justice issues, not just immigration.

It's also lovely to hear the beauty of his ideas and the poetry of his voice:
- Martin Luther King, Jr., "What Is Your Life's Blueprint?" https://youtu.be/ZmtOGXreTOU?si=_c_jlA2zlpr0mJ_U pt20m
- (1967-10-26). MLK90: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Calls For The End Of Poverty In The Modern World. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/20NQQr2Iu_E. pt1m. Speaking to students at Barratt Junior High School in Philadelphia

19:00 #cognition/my-education #culture I'm taking a class "Philosophy of Education and Urban School Policy" (ED 402) for my Masters in Education for Science Education. We're reading [*The Communist Manifesto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto) (Marx & Engels 1848). It's our first reading because some much of the the later readings are in response to it. It was a short but dense reading, roughly 30 pages. My interpretation is that while class struggles have always existed between the oppressors and the oppressed, mass production and capitalism have irrevocably changed the relationship. Before there were relatively natural and human roles, but now everything and everyone is a commodity, but increasingly owned by few. This reduces the classes to the very many proletariats and the very few bourgeois. These the days Americans tend to call foreign bourgeois "oligarchs", but domestic bourgeois "billionaires".

These days the class struggle is undeniable. Oligarchs run government, the media, the military industrial complex, healthcare, etc. Since [Citizens United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) effectively enables bribery legal, it is hard to see a way to fix things nicely. Per *The Communist Manifesto*, class struggles eventually resolve, and "The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win." (ibid).

The general measures that *The Communist Manifesto* ask are mostly reasonable:

> [!quote]
> 1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
> 2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
> 3. Abolition of all right of inheritance.
> 4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
> 5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
> 6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State .
> 7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
> 8. Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture .
> 9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country, by a more equable distribution of the population over the country.
> 10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c., &c.

I don't intend to do a long write up here, but I will say that I don't think we'll ever abolish property in America but we could effectively abolish bourgeois property with better taxation. *The Communist Manifesto*  discusses flawed variants of Communism. "Conservative Socialism" and "Critical-Utopian Socialism" both sound like dreamers that try work within the system and solve things nicely, but don't address the root causes. It reminds me of [Neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism).

The bourgeois in America have worked long and hard to give Communism and Socialism a negative connotation, while keeping most folks ignorant of what it actually means. In one sense you don't even need to use the word "Communism". 
- You can can talk of living wage: Why has [minimum wage in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States) been stuck at $7.25 per hour since 2009?
- America can easily afford a [Universal Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income).
- Why is America the only wealthy industrialized nation without [universal health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care)?
- America had a much better [progressive taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax) in 1970 than  today.
- Why are there people who want to regress education, child labor laws, and so on?

Martin Luther King Jr. was pushing for many of the same changes that Communism wants through non-violence. What a powerful experience to read *The Communist Manifesto* on Martin Luther King Jr. Day while listening to *[Redemption Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_Song)* (Bob Marley 1980): "None but ourselves can free our minds".
