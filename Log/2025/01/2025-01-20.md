11:27 It's [Martin Luther King Jr. Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day) here in America. My family went out and handed out cards to help people know your rights  when encountering ICE (https://www.icirr.org/resources). Of course MLKJ Day is about many justice issues, not just immigration.
