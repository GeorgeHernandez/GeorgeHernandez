22:00 #courage/my-exercise #courage/my-martial-arts I did FMA workshop for Haymaker Gym at [Rizal Center](https://rizalcenter.org). Around 20 participants. Intros. Warmup: 8 (gapping pushups, rolling situps, floor to ceiling squats), 4 (pike pushups, hands feet bridges, pistols/lateral squats), then 8 & 4 again. Philippine history, culture, martial arts,, pre-colonial, colonial, post-colonial (modern). Pre-colonial: Shield & spear with then without gear, fighting long to closing. Standing, footwork, terminology, angles, true cross blocking. Demo of bridging the gap to grappling to *sinawali*.  Ended with an after action review circle where everyone got to say stuff. Lots of fun!
