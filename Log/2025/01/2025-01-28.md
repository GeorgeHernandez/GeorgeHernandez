14:04 #cognition/my-education Yesterday I read on the CTA, taught all day at CPS, had evening classes at UIC, then worked on the slides and practice activity for CPS until 03:00. Today I've been teaching all day, then I have to read on the CTA, do my therapy session, and have dinner with the family.
