14:04 #cognition/my-education Yesterday I read on the CTA, taught all day at CPS, had evening classes at UIC, then worked on the slides and practice activity for CPS until 03:00. Today I've been teaching all day, then I have to read on the CTA, do my therapy session, and have dinner with the family.

22:55 #cognition/my-education I just finished reading Lecture 7 Domination and Hegemony  of "Cultural Studies 1983" (Stuart Hall 2016). Here is the comment I put in our class discussion board:
> Gramsci and Hall move us from simplistic reductionist Marxism to the complex "tendential balance in the relations of force" (p. 161). A mature hegemonic bloc that engages in interweaving coercion and consent in a "war of position" is so pervasive on so many fronts as to both omnipresent and invisible. Hegemony is almost certainly amplified with modern social media.

> BTW: The discussion of predicting crises reminded me of Isaac Asimov's psychohistory. A quick google search of "Gramsci psychohistory" turned up "Foundation and Reality: Asimovâ€™s Psychohistory and Its Real-World Parallels" (Mark Cole 2012 https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/cole_11_12/), which also discussed Marx, Spengler, Toynbee, and Sorokin.
