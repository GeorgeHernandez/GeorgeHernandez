07:06 I have schoolwork to do but I'm going to spend some time today on [[MyManifesto|My  Manifesto]]. I've previously collected various [[Heuristics]], but that was just a dump of things loosely organized. My goal of my manifesto is to make it more concise than comprehensive.

> Subject: Communist Manifesto
> 1. The Manifesto mentions "democracy" once (p. 490). If communism is for the proletariat, the common man, then communism fits a definition of democracy as "a system of government in which state power is vested in the people or the general population of a state". And yet Americans have decades of propaganda conflating communism with anti-democratic. (FYI: Search reveals that the larger book mentions democracy 81x, democratic 92x, democrats 31x.)Â 
> 2. The crux of the Manifesto seems to be the last few paragraphs of section I. Bourgeois and Proletarians (p. 483). What leads up to it is the history of the oppressed and oppressors, but eventually the bourgeois and Modern Industry reach a state where the proletariats are driven to angry pauperism and inevitable open revolution by the proletariats. It seems that the revolt could be relatively easily avoided by meeting at least some of the communist demands (p. 490), and yet since the Manifesto was written we've seen runaway bourgeois greed, capitalism, oligarchies, monopolies, injustice, and fascism over and over again --including present times. Once things get to angry pauperism (unaffordable food, housing, healthcare, education, etc.), then it's just a matter of planning and executing open revolutions.
