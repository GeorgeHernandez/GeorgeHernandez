#note-taking #cognition/my-education That concludes my first full month of daily journaling or note taking. It wasn't that hard. A concept that we've been focusing on at UIC is that one should "reflect on experience" instead of assuming one will automatically learn from experience. The phrase "reflect on experience" has a more human and vernacular vibe than [after-action review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-action_review) techniques of the U.S. Army. The phrase also has more direction than "journaling".
