21:21 #courage/my-exercise Quick pre-shower exercise. My KB complex 4x, but I've modified it again so it now has 13 parts:
1. Deadlift
2. Romanian DL
3. Straight leg DL
4. Bent row
5. Swing to shoulder
6. Swing to crown
7. Curl
8. Squat
9. Shoulder press
10. Overhead squat
11. Overhead windmill
12. Clean and jerk
13. Snatch

I'll keep it at 15 Kg to make sure I have a feel for the overhead windmill I added.
