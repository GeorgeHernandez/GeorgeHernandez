22:06 #cognition/my-education My class at UIC discussed 3 reading:
- Antonio Gramsci, The Role of the Intellectuals
- Henry Giroux, “Critical Theory and Education” from Theory and Resistance in Education 
- Stuart Hall, Domination and Hegemony from Cultural Studies 1983

My favorite points include:
- One of the highest priorities is to raise consciousness that we're all proletariats (working class, etc.). Otherwise we're part of the machinery that helps the status quo persist. 
- The status quo is actually fragile and must be constantly maintained. Thus it is good to resist.
