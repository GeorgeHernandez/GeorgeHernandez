22:06 #cognition/my-education My class at UIC discussed 3 reading:
- Antonio Gramsci, The Role of the Intellectuals
- Henry Giroux, “Critical Theory and Education” from Theory and Resistance in Education 
- Stuart Hall, Domination and Hegemony from Cultural Studies 1983

My favorite points include:
- One of the highest priorities is to raise consciousness that we're all proletariats (working class, etc.). Otherwise we're part of the machinery that helps the status quo persist. 
- Gramsci said "All men are intellectuals, one could therefore say: but not all men have in society the function of intellectuals" (Prison Notebooks 1929 p. 115). Intellectuals are not merely formed organically for different domains like science, agriculture, medicine, etc. but for also shaping and directing our social and political worlds. 
    - Gramsci would have opposed [The Heritage Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation), the horrible American conservative think tank founded in 1973. It pushed Reagan, Trump, [Project 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025), etc.. They effectively push what is currently branded as [Christian nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_nationalism) but is really [white supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy)j, [Christian supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_supremacy), [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism), etc.    - 
- The status quo is actually fragile and must be constantly maintained. Thus it is good to resist.
