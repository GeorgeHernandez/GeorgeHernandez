07:50 #courage/my-exercise  3 sets of (arm swinging half squats pt3m, my KB complex) KB 15 Kg. The KB complex has been feeling pretty smooth, so I think I might up it to 15.5 Kg. I'm modifying my KB complex by changing the swing to a swing to shoulder height then a swing to crown height. That is, my KB complex now has 12 parts:
1. Deadlift
2. Romanian DL
3. Straight leg DL
4. Bent row
5. Swing to shoulder
6. Swing to crown
7. Curl
8. Squat
9. Shoulder press
10. Overhead squat
11. Clean and jerk
12. Snatch

For me the limiting exercise is the curl or shoulder press, i.e. the other movements are easier in comparison.

Surprisingly my toe feels better than yesterday. Usually it gets worse before it gets better. Perhaps ramping up hydration is working.
