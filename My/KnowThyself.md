# 1. Know Thyself

summary:: A few things about me.
parents: [[My]]

The Ancient Greek aphorism ["know thyself"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself) is one the three Delphic maxims inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. This phrase can be interpreted in many ways but usually it means that it is helpful and wise to contemplate on yourself. On the other hand, one of the other maxims inscribed at the same temple is "nothing to excess", so don't over examine yourself.

It is prudent to be introspective (in moderation), but people also love to do it. People are fascinated with themselves because we have to deal with ourselves all the time. People also want to know more about the other people, especially those that we have to deal with. Heck people are social animals who like stories and patterns, so we like to learn about other people in general. Knowing yourself and others reduces social friction, creates empathy, improves problem solving, and so on.

And yet I'm an introvert. I like introspection, quiet, and solitude. See [Why Few People Prefer To Be Alone | Sadhguru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeUX8ail1-U). And yet sometimes I find myself, others, and all of existence to be noisy and annoying. Can you say ["cognitive dissonance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)?

So here I am in a few bullet points. No one can really tell everything about themselves.

## 1.1. Birth

I was born in 1968 in the Philippines then moved to Chicago as a toddler

- Your age is your age. I don't worry about being too young or too old.
- I could be classified as a first generation Filipino American. Growing up my parents did not persist the native tongue, so I've lost much of my Filipino cultural heritage.
- My parents left my younger brother and I in the Philippines while they seized a window to go the America. When we were reunited I did not recognize my own parents. Who can really say how this affected me.
- Culturally by geography I define myself in this order: Part of the Universe, World citizen, Chicagoan, Midwestern American, Filipino.

## 1.2. SSD

I lost all hearing in my left ear because of an infection I had as a baby.

- I used to be shy about this, but since my twenties I've found it more practical to just tell people as needed.
- My single-sided deafness has affected my communication style: I tend to be epistemological, explicit & verify. As a child SSD combined with my immigrant enhanced my introverted & isolated outlook. SSD contributes to my annoyance when knowable things are unknown, and yet I am at peace with things that I can't hear and can't know.

## 1.3. MA

I've done a lot of martial arts.

- My dad had us do boxing since I was 7. I was a seasoned 3rd degree black belt in Shotokan Karate. I did nearly two decades with the Chicago Swordplay Guild doing rapier, longsword, spear, etc. I have and do firearms & archery. I've studied and rolled in various martials ranging from Filipino to Judo to Aikido to MMA. I've broken bones and teeth: mine & others.
- I pondered upon [_bushido_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido) and the ["Hagakure"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagakure) for a long time. Thinking about death & violence. Not just strategy & tactics, but other issues such as legal & philosophical. I was also a Veterinary Assistant and used [method acting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting) with each euthanasia as if I were killing a human being; In hindsight I would not recommend such a rabbit hole to anyone. I have fished, hunted, and slaughtered.
- However starting in my lower 50s my blood stopped boiling. Even before my 50s I've been realizing that even though martial arts is about violence & death, we are human beings and can't help also making it about so many other things: context, exercise, social growth, a wonderful game, self-expression, strategy, teaching & sharing.

## 1.4. Climate

I graduated college with a degree in Chemical Engineering because I wanted to help with climate change.

- The Environmental Protection Agency wasn't hiring and I just started doing computer programming, databases, IT, and health IT.
- I have always felt regret that I never got to combat climate change professionally. The guilt grows as the climate emergency worsens. And yet "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans".

## 1.5. Religion

I was raised Catholic but I'm an atheist

- I was raised Catholic, I went to Catholic grade school, I was an unmolested Altar Boy, and most of my relatives are Catholic.
- Even though I had Catholic nurturing, I've been an atheist since I was 7. My nature is epistemological and open. I try to find what is helpful from anywhere, any time, anyone, etc. It's a matter of backing a worldview with reasons and evidence, and, as attributed to Abraham Lincoln: "When I do good I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion.".
- Everyone finds their own path in forming their worldview.

## 1.6. Health

- Exercise: In addition to martial arts, I exercise a lot. My father was an exercise enthusiast.
- Diet. I'm not much of a hedonist. I don't like to drink, smoke, or do drugs. I don't eat a lot. However I like salt (a lot), sugar, real bacon, & real ice cream.
- I have [gout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout) because Filipinos are genetically disposed to having gout.

## 1.7. Family and Friends

- I love my darling wife Julia and our three kids. I am a much richer, fuller, and sociable person for having them in my life. The are easily the best part of my life.
- I've had a few genuine friends. I am grateful for everyone of them. Sadly the majority of them have passed on.

## 1.8. My Acronyms

- ‚úä HExMAS: Health. Exercise. Martial Arts. Survival.
- ü•º STEM: Science. Technology. Engineering. Math. Includes Comuter Science and Engineering (CSE).
- üå± GRAMPS: Grow [plants]. Read & write. Art. Make. Play [music, games, etc.]. Silly.

## 1.9. As a Person

- üêà I am a calm, candid, & curious cat who strives to be a courageous, creative, & kind contributor.
<!-- - Since my 30s I've been craving non-existence. I'm not yet sure if this is physiological/psychological depression or more of a philosophical outlook. I love my family and I don't think I'm at risk of self harm, but possibly my craving limits my self-actualization. In Buddhism craving non-existence is a type of [_tanha_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81) (craving), called _vibhava tanha_, which is partially due to suffering and wrong view annihilation, i.e. that there is no rebirth. I don't know about nirvana, _moksha_, or heaven. This life, this "movie", has its ups and downs, but overall I feel like I've seen it before and I often wish the movie would end, that I would blink out of existence and become non-sentient or even non-life. -->
- [Trait theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory). I'm not here to evaluate the quality of the research behind the various theories, rather the traits are useful starting points for examining yourself and others. I'm not a psychologist, etc. so my self-evaluation may be flawed. I'll start with the traits from the [HEXACO model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEXACO_model_of_personality_structure).
  - Honesty-Humility
    - Tendency towards sincerity, modesty, fairness, and greed avoidance. Those who score high on this trait feel little desire to manipulate others or to break the rules for personal gain.

      - Kantianism. Treating people as ends unto themselves, not mere means.
      - Humanism. Valuing the dignity and worth of each individual.

      - ¬´the light triad was related to greater _interpersonal guilt_ ‚Äî including _survivor_ ("I sometimes feel I don't deserve the happiness I achieved"), _separation_ ("It makes me anxious to be away from home for too long") and _omnipotent responsibility_ ("I worry a lot about the people I love even when they seem to be fine") forms of guilt.¬ª - Kaufman, Scott Barry Kaufman.

I like to fight and do martial arts, but it's for fun, developing character and skill, etc, i.e. I'm rarely angry at opponents. I will mutter and swear while driving but I don't have road rage. I sometimes get annoyed by problems that could have been prevented, but I try to remember that it happens.
  - Self-esteem
    - A "favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the self" (Rosenberg, 1965). An individual's sense of his or her value or worth, or the extent to which a person values, approves of, appreciates, prizes, or l

    - The inability to express emotions.
    - ME: 70%. **Alas, I wish I could more easily say "I love you"**, but it doesn't come easy. Possibly related to having 7 brothers & 1 sister. I wonder how much this contributes to my anti-hedonism?
  - Rigidity
