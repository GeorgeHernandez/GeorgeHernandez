# Blade Anatomy

summary:: The basic parts of bladed gear like swords and knives.
parents:: [[Courage]]

This page focuses on identifying the terminology of key parts of many bladed gear like swords and knives. It is beyond the scope of this page to discuss in depth all swords and knives, all bladed gear (like axes and spears), in all languages.

**Figure:** A schematic of a fictional blade to help with identifying the parts of bladed gear. I made it in 2015 (or earlier).<br>![[2025-01-11_Blade_Anatomy.gif]]

There are several common **Reference Positions** when discussing swords and knives:
- **Scabbard Reference**: Point down as if sheathed or hanging on a wall. This as shown in the figure. Used in [Oakeshott typology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakeshott_typology) for the 13 medieval blade types (X to XXII) primarily because blades often inscriptions oriented in this fashion.
- **Cut Reference**: Point up, heaven grip, hand forward, wrist rotation neutral.
- **Thrust Reference**: Point forward, flashlight grip, wrist rotation neutral.

## Primary Properties

There are several primary properties of blades.
- **Mass** (Weight) of the gear.
- **Profile** refers to the perpendicular distance from back edge to front edge.
  - In Scabbard Reference: The left-to-right distance, as if viewing a person's profile.
  - In Cut Reference: The front-back x-axis.
  - E.g. Cutting sword tend to have large profiles, while thrusting swords tend to have narrow profiles.
- **Thickness** refers to the measure of the back edge, front edge, or central cross-section. 
  - In Scabbard Reference: The front-back distance.
  - In Cut Reference: The left-right y-axis.
  - E.g. A Kitchen Knife typically has a thick back edge and a thin front edge.
- **Length** may refer to either the **Blade Length** (*Nagasa* in Japanese) or **Overall Length**. 
  - In Scabbard Reference: The top-bottom distance.
  - In Cut Reference: The top-bottom z-axis.
  - **Grip Length** is the length of the handle, and usually includes the pommel.
  - **Distal** is towards the hand.
  - **Proximal** is towards the tip.

## Basic Parts

### Pommel

The **Pommel** (Butt, *Punyo* in Filipino, *Kashira* in Japanese) can be used for impact but it can also be used as a counterweight or enlarged to make for a more secure grip. 
- [Karambits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karambit) are known for having a **Finger Hole** on the Pommel. 
- Many swords lack an enlarged pommel, e.g. a [Katana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana). 

### Grip

The **Grip** (Handle) usually aligns with the axis of the blade. 
- A **Pistol Grip** is a distant 2nd design. 
- For some gear the length is more for counterbalance than extra grip room, e.g. a [Dha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dha_(sword)). 
- The **Handedness** of swords is a combination of grip length and blade length.
  - E.g. [Zweihänder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zweih%C3%A4nder).
  - E.g. For [Japanese Swords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_sword):
    - [Nodachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodachi), [Ōdachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cdachi), [Jin tachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_tachi): 90.9 cm and over (more than three shaku)
    - [Tachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachi), [Katana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana): over 60.6 cm (more than two shaku)
    - [Wakizashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakizashi): between 30.3 and 60.6 cm (between one and two shaku)
    - [Tantō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tant%C5%8D), [Aikuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikuchi): under 30.3 cm (less than one shaku)
- The **Tang** (*Nakago* in Japanese) is an extension of the blade into the grip. In some swords, metadata may be found on the tang. 
  - A **Full Tang** runs through the entire grip, while a **Partial Tang** does not.
  - On Japanese swords the tang is encased in a *Fuchi* sleeve held in with a *Mekugi* plug. The tang may have a *Mei* signture on it.

> [!info] Grips
> The concept of the "grip of a sword" is related to "how to grip a sword". Primarily:
> - **Cut Grip** vs **Thrust Grip**. See Cut Reference vs Thrust Reference above. Both are common.
> - **Heaven Grip** vs **Earth Grip**. The blade sticks out on either the thumb side or pinky side. Heaven grip is far more common.
> - **Forward Grip** vs **Backward Grip**. The front edge either faces forward or backward. Forward grip is far more common.
> - **Wrist Rotation**. There are 5 primary rotations:
>   - Neutral. Palm inward
>   - Pronated. Palm downward.
>   - Hyper Pronated. Palm outward.
>   - Supinated. Palm upward
>   - Hyper Supinated. Palm inward from across your body.
> - **Fingering Grips**. 1-3 fingers sneaking forward for more control.
>   - **Back Edge Thumbing** vs **Flat Thumbing**. E.g. Commonly the former with some saber grips, the latter with the *ZwerchHau* of German *Kunst des Fechtens* or covering with the flat.

### Guard

The **Guard** includes parts around the grip and base of the sword that serve to protect the hand.
  - Many swords have no guard or minimal guards. Various reasons for this include:
    - The swords were used with shields.
    - Convenience & less encumbering.
    - Guards, armor, and such were banned by colonizers.
  - A **Bolster** is a piece that joins the handle to the blade/guard. A bolster may serve as a finger guard, as well as adding weight and balance to a knife.
    - On Japanese swords the guard consists of a *Habaki* ferrule cap, a  *Seppa* spacer, the *Tsuba* a small circular guard, and another *Seppa* spacer.
  - A **[Crossguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossguard)** can be as simple as a bar that is perpendicular to grip and sword.
    - A **Quillon** is a bar on either side of the blade, i.e. a sword may have 0..2 quillons.
  - Guards came in various complexities beyond a simple crossguard:
    - A **Nagel** ("nail") is like a mini-crossguard on the dorsal flat side, i.e. perpendicular to the cross, common on German [Messers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messer_(sword).
    - Knuckle Guards, Finger Guards, Side Rings, Plates, Cups, etc. for Swept-Hilt and Cup Hilt [Rapiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapier) and other swords.
  - **[Basket-Hilted Swords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket-hilted_sword)** have the hand fully encased. E.g. The Schiavona or Scottish Broadsword.

### Blade

There are 4 **Sides** of a blade (using the Cut Reference Position).
- The **Front Edge** (Edge, True Edge, Cutting Edge, Front, Long, Inner, Filo Dritto in Italian) is the far side of the blade.
- The **Back Edge** (False Edge, Back Edge, Short Edge, Outer Edge, Dull Edge, Spine, *Filo Falso* in Italian, *Mune* in Japanese) is the near side of the blade.
  - The terms Long & Short make more sense on a curved blade.    
  - The terms Back, Dull & Spine makes more sense on a single-edged blade.
- The **Inner Flat** (Inner Face, Inner Cheek) refers to the palm side of the blade.
- The **Outer Flat** (Outer Face, Outer Cheek) refers to the backhand side of the blade.

Blades may **0..2 Edges**:
- An **Unedged Blade** may be a thrusting weapon only. E.g. **[Estoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estoc)**.
- A **Single-Edged Blade** (*Dao* in Chinese) has 1 edge or 1 edge and the back edge sharpened near the tip.
- A **Double-Edged Blade** (*Jian* in Chinese) as 2 edges.

The **3 Portions** of a blade:

The **Strong** (Forte, *Jin Fushi* in Japanese) is roughly the 1/4 to 1/3 closer to the grip, but really it's a relative term. The strong has better leverage, requires less torque at the hand, but is slower. Typically defensive.
  - The **Shoulder** border between the blade and the tang. Often the blade is wider than the tang, hence it looks like a shoulder. 
  - The **Choil**, if present, is distally between the sharpened edge and the shoulder. The main kinds:
    - An **Unsharpened Choil** for finger control, so sharpening has a boundary, the strong does not need to be sharp, etc.
      - A **[Ricasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricasso)** is an unsharpened choil found on swords past the cross guard. 
      - A **Schilt** is like a shield-shaped choil on German [Feders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feder_(fencing)). It is like a guard but on the blade instead of the guard.
      - A **Thumb Rise** (Thumb Rest) on the back is where the thumb may rest to help with support and aim.
    - A **Sharpened Choil** for fine detailed cutting work. It may be notch within an unsharpened choil for particular purposes.
    - A **Nail Mark** (Nail Groove) is found on the flat near the back edge on some  folding knives so you can use a fingernail to grab the blade. Some knives have a hole instead that do the same job.    
  - The **Heel** is roughly the lower 1/5 of the sharpened  edge of a knives. It is used for fast chopping or slower careful work.

The **Belly** (*Chi Fushi* in Japanese) is roughly the middle 1/2 or 1/3 of the blade, but really it's a relative term. Typically for winding (Winden in German) control, transitioning from offense to defense.

The **Weak** (Debole, Foible, *Ten Fushi* in Japanese) is roughly the 1/4 or 1/3, but really it's a relative term. The weak has worse leverage, requires more torque at the hand, but is faster. Typically offensive.
  - The **Tip** (Point, Punta, *Kissaki* in Japanese). Useful for thrusting, scoring, scooping, etc.

## Secondary Properties

 The **[Center of Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass)** (CoM) is where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero. This is usually equivalent to the **Center of Gravity** (CoG, Balance Point (BP), Point of Balance (PoB)) where the resultant torque due to gravity forces vanish. This is easily found by balancing the sword on a pivot (like your finger).

The **[Center of Percussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_percussion)** (CoP, Sweet Spot) is a point on blade where if you attach the blade to a pivot, then a perpendicular impact at the CoP  will produce no reactive shock at pivot.

The **Taper** of a blade refers to the thinning (from grip to tip) of either its thickness or profile.
- **Profile Taper** refers to the thinning of the profile from grip to tip. E.g. Cutting swords may stay the same profile throughout most of the length (or even widen at some points), whereas a thrusting sword almost always has a clear profile taper.
- **Distal Taper** refers to the thinning of the thickness from grip to tip. E.g. Cutting swords may not have distal taper until the tip, whereas thrusting swords almost always have clear distal taper.

The **Sharpness** of a blade refers to the fineness of the application point of a blade.
- A **Sharp Edge** refers to a thin cutting edge. The edge should be hard (because there is less material), but in many case not so hard that it is difficult to resharpen.
  - The **[Hamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamon_(swordsmithing))** ("edge pattern") of Japanese swords is a visible effect created on the blade by the hardening process between the harder cutting edge and the softer spine.
- A **Sharp Point** refers to a narrow point. A sharp point is good for piercing, but a long thin point may be vulnerable to fracturing.

The **Veer** of a blade refers to how the front edge and back edge are straight, convex, or concave. 
  - A **Straight** blade is not curved. E.g. a [Jian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jian).
  - A **Convex** (Curved) blade curves away from the edge, e.g. a [Scimitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scimitar). 
  - A **Concave** (Recurved) blade curves toward the edge, e.g. a [Kukri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukri.

  The back and front edges may not veer in the same fashion.
  - **Straight Back** (S1). Kitchen knifes typically have a straight back and a curved belly.
  - **Trailing Point** (S2). Very curved belly & back. E.g. A [Filet Knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillet_knife).
  - **Drop Point** (S3). Curved belly. Recurved back.
  - **Clip Point** (S4). Curved belly. Curved sharp back. E.g. A [Bowie knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowie_knife).
  - **Sheepsfoot** (S5). Straight belly. Recurved dull back. Lots of control since you can finger the tip.- Wharncliffe. A Sheepsfoot but with the recurve going further up.
  - **Wharncliffe** (S6). Like Sheepsfoot but the top of the curve is closer to the grip.
  - **Spey Point** (S7). Steeply curved belly. Steeply chiseled but dull back. For when you don't want to penetrate like skinning.
  - **Leaf Blade** (C1). Curved sharp belly. Received sharp back. A waist further up.
  - **Spear Point** (C2). Curved sharp belly. Received sharp back. Symmetric & strong on the thrust.
  - **Needle Point** (C3). Straight but sharply angled. Symmetric. Good for thrusts but can break. E.g. The [Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairbairn%E2%80%93Sykes_fighting_knife).
  - **[Kris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris)** (Flame Bladed) (C4). Wavy edge on the front edge or back edge or both.
  - **Tanto** (C5). Like a Spey point but angular. Stabs fairly but with less chance of breaking like a Needle point. FYI: The shape is not really like an actual [Tantō ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tant%C5%8D).
  - **Hawkbill** (C6). Recurved and sharp belly and back.
  - **[Ulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulu)** (Head Knife) (C7). The grip is perpendicular to the usual orientation.

The **Bevel** (Grind) refers to the cross-section shape of the blade. Here are some of the more common cross-sections:
- **Wedge** is roughly an isosceles triangle: A  back and 2 equal sized flats.
- **Chisel** is roughly a right triangle with an extra grind applied at the edge.
- **Fuller** (*Hi* in Japanese) is a blade with a groove (or 2) that runs down the center of the flat.
- **Riser** (*Shinogi* in Japanese) is a blade with a ridge that runs the center of the flat. Risers stiffen the blade.
  - **Diamond** is common on double-edged blades with a riser.
  - **Hollow Ground** is like diamond but the flats are concave.

There are other secondary properties such as **Materials**, **Manufacturing Process** (especially forging & heat treating), **Price**, and **Context** behind a sword or knife that are beyond the scope of this page.
