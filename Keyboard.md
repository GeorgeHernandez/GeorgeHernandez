# My Keyboard

My keyboard requirements and preferences.

## Requirements

- Layout: US QWERTY. Not the most efficient but I'm used to it and so would most American guest users on my keyboard. Also I would be able to find most keys by feel without looking at the keyboard.
- Ten Key Less (TKL). Aka 80%. I used to prefer 104 keys (100%) but getting rid of the numeric keypad saves valuable desktop space. Some keyboard shortcuts are made assuming a numeric keypad but these can be remapped or avoided or re-implmented with hardware for the numeric keyboard.
- Wired. No batteries to replace or recharge. A wireless keyboard is OK if it also has an option to be wired.
- `F1`-`F12` keys grouped in sets of 4. Ideally each set would be color differentiated.
- Double Shot Keys. 2 plastics are used: 1 for the key and 1 for the see-through character. This way I never have to deal with the paint rubbing off, which has happened several times over the years. If the paint is durable then this isn't necessary.
- Bottom Row. `ctrl`, `win`, `alt`, `space`, `altgr`, `fn`, `menu`, `ctrl`. FYI: PowerToys can't remap a `fn` key, but it can remap the `menu` key; I almost never use the `menu` key and it can be done with `shift+f10`. A `fn` may be on the right but definitely not on the left.
- Bonus Controls. Should be outside of the usual layout. E.g. Media Keys or Volume Wheel.

## Preferences

- Volume Wheel. Nice but volume control via keys works too.
- Water Resistant. A "water proof" claim is questionable.
- Pass Through Cabling. Use for a mouse or a numeric keypad.
- Large Print. In theory this helps, but it looks odd.

## FYI

- To use a Windows keyboard on a Mac:
  - `alt` works as `option` (`⌥`)
  - `win` (`⊞`) works as `cmd` (`⌘`)
- Mechanical switches. Both the bump & the click provide some personal satisfaction but the noise may annoy others. I don't type fast enough for the bump to make a difference in my speed.
  - Red/linear switch keys have no bump & are quiet.
  - Brown/tactile switch keys have a bump & are quiet.
  - Blue/clicky switch keys have a bump & are clicky.
