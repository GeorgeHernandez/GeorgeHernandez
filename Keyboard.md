# My Keyboard

My keyboard requirements and preferences.

## Requirements

- **Layout**: US QWERTY. Not the most efficient but I'm used to it and so would most American guest users on my keyboard. Muscle memory allows one to find most keys by feel, i.e. without looking at the keyboard.
- **Wired**: No batteries to replace or recharge. A wireless keyboard is OK if it also has an option to be wired.
- `F1`-`F12` keys grouped in sets of 4. This allows them to be located by feel. Ideally each set would be color differentiated.
- **Quiet**: People get annoyed when they can hear your typing during meetings.
- **Volume **wheel. A volume wheel is preferred over volume keys because it can be adjusted without looking. Clicking the wheel should mute, but quickly dialing up/down can work.
- **Double shot keys**: Aka translucent keykaps. 2 plastics are used: 1 for the key and 1 for the see-through character. This way I never have to deal with the paint rubbing off, which has happened often over the years.

## Preferences

- **Key count**: I waffle between 104 keys (100%) and 84 keys (80%), aka Ten Key Less (TKL). My muscle memory prefers the former, but the latter restores valuable desktop space. Some keyboard shortcuts are made assuming a numeric keypad but these can be remapped or avoided or re-implmented with hardware for the numeric keyboard. 96%, 75%, etc. layouts are even tighter but the layouts are inconsistent or not preferable. E.g. If you're going to include the `home`, `page up`, `page down`, `end` keys, then they should be provided in that order.
- **Bottom row keys**: Ideally: `ctrl`, `win`, `alt`, `fn`, `menu`, `space`, `fn`, `altgr`, `win`, `menu`, `ctrl`. However I would settle for the [US-International layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_and_American_keyboards#/media/File:KB_US-International.svg): `ctrl`, `win`, `alt`, `space`, `altgr`, `win`, `menu`, `ctrl`. Sadly these days many keyboards have either the right `win` or right `menu` key replaced with a `fn` key. FYI: The `menu` key can also be done with `shift+f10`. PowerToys can't remap a `fn` key, but it can remap the `menu` key.
- **Bonus controls**: I don't want extra keys for bonus controls because I don't use them a lot. Accessing media keys, brightness keys, and such via the `fn` key is fine. It's particularly vexing to occupy precious desktop space with a new row just for bonus controls.
- **Low profile keys**: Lighter, more accurate, less strain, less travel. Not a priority.
- **Water resistant keys**: A "water proof" claim is questionable. Not a priority.
- **Pass through cabling**: Use for a mouse or a numeric keypad. Ideally it would be included with all the smaller (80% & down) keyboards. Not a priority.
- **Large print**: In theory this would help, but it looks odd.

## FYI

- **Windows-Mac**: To use a Windows keyboard on a Mac:
  - `alt` works as `option` (`⌥`)
  - `win` (`⊞`) works as `cmd` (`⌘`)
- **Key switches**: Both the bump & the click provide some personal satisfaction, but the noise may annoy others. I don't type fast enough for the bump to make a difference in my typing rate.
  - Red/linear mechanical switch keys have no bump & are quiet.
  - Brown/tactile mechanical switch keys have a bump & are quiet.
  - Blue/clicky mechanical switch keys have a bump & are clicky.
  - Optical switch key rely on breaking a beam instead of physical contact. Not many choices available yet.
