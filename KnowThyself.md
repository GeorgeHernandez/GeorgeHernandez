# Know Thyself

The Ancient Greek aphorism ["know thyself"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself) is one the three Delphic maxims inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. This pharse can be interpreted in many ways but usually it means that it is helpful and wise to  contemplate on yourself. On the other hand, one of the other maxims inscribed at the same temple is "nothing to excess", so don't over examine yourself.

It is prudent to be introspective (in moderation), but people also love to do it. People are fascinated with themselves because we have to deal with ourselves all the time. People also want to know more about the other people, especially those that we have to deal with. Heck people are social animals who like stories and patterns, so we like to learn about other people in general. Knowing yourself and others reduces social friction, creates empathy, improves problem solving, and so on.

And yet I'm an introvert and like to be quiet and sometimes I find all of existence to be noisy and annoying. Can you say ["cognitive dissonance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)?

So here I am in a few bullet points. No one can really tell everything about themselves.

- I was born in 1968 in the Phillippines then moved to Chicago as a toddler
    - Your age is your age. I don't worry about being too young or too old.
    - I could be classified as a first generation Filipino American. Growing up my parents did not persist the native tounge, so I've lost much of my Filipino cultural heritage.
    - Culturally by geography I define myself in this order: Part of the Universe, World citizen, Chicagoan, Midwestern American, Filipino.
- I lost all hearing in my left ear because of an infection I had as a baby.
    - I used to be shy about this, but since my twenties I've found it more practical to just tell people as needed.
    - My single-sided deafness has affected my communication style: I tend to be explicit & verify.
- I've done a lot of martial arts.
    - My dad had us do boxing since I was 7. I was a seasoned 3rd degree black belt in Shotokan Karate. I did nearly two decades with the Chicago Swordplay Guild doing rapier, longsword, spear, etc. I have and do guns. I've studied and rolled in various martials ranging from Filipino to Judo to Aikido to MMA. I've broken bones and teeth: mine & others.
    - However starting in my lower 50s my blood stopped boiling and I'm just not interested in fighting as much as I used to.
- I graduated college with a degree in Chemical Engineering because I wanted to help with climate change.
    - The Environmental Protection Agency wasn't hiring and I just started doing computer programming, databases, IT, and health IT.
    - Given the climate emergency, I feel regret that I never did combat climate change professionally. And yet "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans".
- I was raised Catholic but I'm an atheist
    - I was raised Catholic, I went to Catholic grade school, I was an Altar Boy, and most of my relatives are Catholic.
    - Even though I had Catholic nurturing, I've been an atheist since I was 7. My nature is epistemological and open. I try to find what is helpful from any where, any when, anyone, etc.
    - Everyone finds their own path in forming their worldview.
- As a person:
    - üêà I am a calm, candid, & curious cat who strives to be a courageous, creative, & kind contributor.
    - Since my 30s I've been craving non-existence. I'm not yet sure if this is physiologica/psychological depression or more of a philiosphical outlook. I love my family and I don't think I'm at risk of self harm, but possibly my craving limits my self-actualization. In Buddhism craving non-existence is a type of [_tanha_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81) (craving), called _vibhava tanha_, that is partially due to suffering and wrong view annihilationism, i.e. that there is no rebirth. In my case this life, this "movie", has its ups and downs, but overall I feel like I've seen it before and I wish the movie would end, that I would blink out of existence and become non-sentient or even non-life.
